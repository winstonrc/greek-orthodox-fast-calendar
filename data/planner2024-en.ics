SUMMARY:Ecclesiastical New Year
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 09/01/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Ecclesiastical New Year; Symeon the Stylite; Synaxis of the Recovery of the Icon of the Most Holy Theotokos of Miasenae ; The 40 Holy Ascetic Virgin Martyrs of Thrace and their Teacher Ammon the Deacon; Holy Martyrs Calliste and Siblings:  Euodus and Hermogenes; Righteous Meletius\, The Struggler of the Muioupolis Mountain; Jesus (Joshua) of Navi; Nicholas of Kourtaliotis\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: John 21:1-14\nAt that time\, Jesus revealed Himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias; and He revealed Himself in this way. Simon Peter\, Thomas\, called the Twin\, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee\, the sons of Zebedee\, and two others of His disciples were together. Simon Peter said to them\, \"I am going fishing.\" They said to him\, \"We will go with you.\" They went out and got into the boat\, but that night they caught nothing. Just as day was breaking\, Jesus stood on the beach\, yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to them\, \"Children\, have you any fish?\" They answered him\, \"No.\" He said to them\, \"Cast the net on the right side of the boat\, and you will find some.\" So they cast it\, and now they were not able to haul it in\, for the quantity of fish. That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter\, \"It is the Lord!\" When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord\, he put on his clothes\, for he was stripped for work\, and sprang into the sea. But the other disciples came in the boat\, dragging the net full of fish\, for they were not far from the land\, but about a hundred yards off. When they got out on land\, they saw a charcoal fire there with fish lying on it\, and bread. Jesus said to them\, \"Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.\" So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore\, full of large fish\, a hundred and fifty-three of them; and although there were so many\, the net was not torn. Jesus said to them\, \"Come and have breakfast.\" Now none of the disciples dared ask Him\, \"Who are you?\" They knew it was the Lord. Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them\, and so with the fish. This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after He was raised from the dead..\n\nEpistle Reading: I Timothy 2:1-7\nTimothy\, my son\, first of all\, I urge that supplications\, prayers\, intercessions\, and thanksgivings be made for all men\, for kings and all who are in high positions\, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life\, godly and respectful in every way. This is good\, and it is acceptable in the sight of God our Savior\, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God\, and there is one mediator between God and men\, the man Christ Jesus\, who gave himself as a ransom for all\, the testimony to which was borne at the proper time. For this I was appointed a preacher and apostle (I am telling the truth\, I am not lying)\, a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 4:16-22\nAt that time\, Jesus came to Nazareth\, where he had been brought up; and he went to the synagogue\, as his custom was\, on the sabbath day. And he stood up to read; and there was given to him the book of the prophet Isaiah. He opened the book and found the place where it was written\, \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me\, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind\, to set at liberty those who are oppressed\, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.\" And he closed the book\, and gave it back to the attendant\, and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. And he began to say to them\, \"Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.\" And all spoke well of him\, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth.\n\n

SUMMARY:Mammas the Martyr
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 09/02/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Mammas the Martyr; John the Abstainer\, Patriarch of Constantinople; Paul\, Patriarch of Constantinople; Cosmas the Hermit; Ammon & Aeithalas the Martyrs of Thrace\n\nEpistle Reading: Romans 8:28-39\nBrethren\, we know that everything works for good with those who love God\, who are called according to his purpose.  For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son\, in order that he might be the first-born among many brethren.  And those whom he predestined he also called; and those whom he called he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified.\n\nWhat then shall we say to this?  If God is for us\, who is against us?  He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all\, will he not also give us all things with him?  Who shall bring any charge against God's elect?  It is God who justifies; who is to condemn?  It is Christ Jesus\, who died\, yes\, who was raised from the dead\, who is at the right hand of God\, who indeed intercedes for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?  Shall tribulation\, or distress\, or persecution\, or famine\, or nakedness\, or peril\, or sword?  As it is written\, \"For thy sake we are being killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.\"  No\, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.  For I am sure that neither death\, nor life\, nor angels\, nor principalities\, nor things present\, nor things to come\, nor powers\, nor height\, nor depth\, nor anything else in all creation\, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 23:13-22\nThe Lord said to the Jews who had come to him\, \"Woe to you\, scribes and Pharisees\, hypocrites! for you devour widows' houses and for a pretense you make long prayers; therefore you will receive the greater condemnation. But woe to you\, scribes and Pharisees\, hypocrites! because you shut the kingdom of heaven against men; for you neither enter yourselves\, nor allow those who would enter to go in. Woe to you\, scribes and Pharisees\, hypocrites! for you traverse sea and land to make a single proselyte\, and when he becomes a proselyte\, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves. Woe to you\, blind guides\, who say\, 'If any one swears by the temple\, it is nothing; but if any one swears by the gold of the temple\, he is bound by his oath.' You blind fools! For which is greater\, the gold or the temple that has made the gold sacred? And you say\, 'If any one swears by the altar\, it is nothing; but if any one swears by the gift that is on the altar\, he is bound by his oath.' You blind men! For which is greater\, the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred? So he who swears by the altar\, swears by it and by everything on it; and he who swears by the temple\, swears by it and by him who dwells in it; and he who swears by heaven\, swears by the throne of God and by him who sits upon it.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Anthimus\, Bishop of Nicomedea
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 09/03/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Anthimus\, Bishop of Nicomedea; Holy Father Theoctistus and his fellow struggler Euthymius the Great; Polydorus the Martyr of New Ephesus; Translation of the relics of St. Nectarius the Wonderworker\, Bishop of Pentopolis; Chariton the Martyr; Phoebe the Deaconess\n\nEpistle Reading: II Corinthians 2:14-17;3:1-3\nBrethren\, thanks be to God\, who in Christ always leads us in triumph\, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere. For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing\, to one a fragrance from death to death\, to the other a fragrance from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things? For we are not\, like so many\, peddlers of God's word; but as men of sincerity\, as commissioned by God\, in the sight of God we speak in Christ.\n\nAre we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need\, as some do\, letters of recommendation\, to you\, or from you? You yourselves are our letter of recommendation\, written on our hearts\, to be known and read by all men; and you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us\, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God\, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 23:23-28\nThe Lord said to the Jews who had come to him\, \"Woe to you\, scribes and Pharisees\, hypocrites! for you tithe mint and dill and cumin\, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law\, justice and mercy and faith; these you ought to have done\, without neglecting the others. You blind guides\, straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel!\n\n\"Woe to you\, scribes and Pharisees\, hypocrites! for you cleanse the outside of the cup and of the plate\, but inside they are full of extortion and rapacity. You blind Pharisee! first cleanse the inside of the cup and of the plate\, that the outside also may be clean.\n\n\"Woe to you\, scribes and Pharisees\, hypocrites! for you are like whitewashed tombs\, which outwardly appear beautiful\, but within they are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. So you also outwardly appear righteous to men\, but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Babylas the Holy Martyr
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 09/04/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Babylas the Holy Martyr; Moses the Prophet & Godseer; Our Righteous Father Anthimus of Coroucle in Cephallenia; Anthimos the new ascetic; Hermione the Martyr\, daughter of St. Philip the Deacon\n\nStrict Fast\n\nEpistle Reading: II Corinthians 3:4-11\nBrethren\, such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God. Not that we are competent of ourselves to claim anything as coming from us; our competence is from God\, who has made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant\, not in a written code but in the Spirit; for the written code kills\, but the Spirit gives life.\n\nNow if the dispensation of death\, carved in letters on stone\, came with such splendor that the Israelites could not look at Moses' face because of its brightness\, fading as this was\, will not the dispensation of the Spirit be attended with greater splendor? For if there was splendor in the dispensation of condemnation\, the dispensation of righteousness must far exceed it in splendor. Indeed\, in this case\, what once had splendor has come to have no splendor at all\, because of the splendor that surpasses it. For if what faded away came with splendor\, what is permanent must have much more splendor.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 23:29-39\nThe Lord said to the Jews who had come to him\, \"Woe to you\, scribes and Pharisees\, hypocrites! for you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous\, saying\, 'If we had lived in the days of our fathers\, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.' Thus you witness against yourselves\, that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets. Fill up\, then\, the measure of your fathers. You serpents\, you brood of vipers\, how are you to escape being sentenced to hell? Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and scribes\, some of whom you will kill and crucify\, and some you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from town to town\, that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth\, from the blood of innocent Abel to the blood of Zacharias the son of Barachiah\, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar. Truly\, I say to you\, all this will come upon this generation.\n\nO Jerusalem\, Jerusalem\, killing the prophets and stoning those who are sent to you! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings\, and you would not! Behold\, your house is forsaken and desolate. For I tell you\, you will not see me again\, until you say\, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Holy Prophet Zacharias\, Father of the Venerable Forerunner
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 09/05/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Holy Prophet Zacharias\, Father of the Venerable Forerunner; Elizabeth\, Mother of the Forerunner; Urban\, Theodore\, & Medimnos the Hieromartyrs and the 77 Companions at Nicomedea\n\nEpistle Reading: II Corinthians 4:1-12\nBrethren\, having this ministry as we have received mercy\, we do not lose heart. We have renounced disgraceful\, underhanded ways; we refuse to practice cunning or to tamper with God's word\, but by the open statement of truth we would commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. And even if our gospel is veiled\, it is veiled only to those who are perishing. In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers\, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ\, who is the likeness of God. For what we preach is not ourselves\, but Jesus Christ as Lord\, with ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake. For it is the God who said\, \"Let light shine out of darkness\,\" who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.\n\nBut we have this treasure in earthen vessels\, to show that the transcendent power belongs to God and not to us. We are afflicted in every way\, but not crushed; perplexed\, but not driven to despair; persecuted\, but not forsaken; struck down\, but not destroyed; always carrying in the body the death of Jesus\, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies. For while we live we are always being given up to death for Jesus' sake\, so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh. So death is at work in us\, but life in you.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 23:29-39\nThe Lord said to the Jews who had come to him\, \"Woe to you\, scribes and Pharisees\, hypocrites! for you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous\, saying\, 'If we had lived in the days of our fathers\, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.' Thus you witness against yourselves\, that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets. Fill up\, then\, the measure of your fathers.

SUMMARY:The Commemoration of the Miracle Wrought by Archangel Michael in Colossae (Chonae)
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 09/06/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: The Commemoration of the Miracle Wrought by Archangel Michael in Colossae (Chonae); Holy Martyr Calodote\n\nFast Day (Wine and Oil Allowed)\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 2:2-10\nBrethren\, if the message declared by angels was valid and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution\, how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord\, and it was attested to us by those who heard him\, while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his own will. For it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come\, of which we are speaking. It has been testified somewhere\, \"What is man that thou art mindful of him\, or the son of man\, that thou carest for him? Thou didst make him for a little while lower than the angels\, thou hast crowned him with glory and honor\, putting everything in subjection under his feet.\" Now in putting everything in subjection to him\, he left nothing outside his control. As it is\, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him. But we see Jesus\, who for a little while was made lower than the angels\, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death\, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for every one. For it was fitting that he\, for whom and by whom all things exist\, in bringing many sons to glory\, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through suffering.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 10:16-21\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"He who hears you hears me\, and he who rejects you rejects me\, and he who rejects me rejects him who sent me.\" The seventy returned with joy\, saying\, \"Lord\, even the demons are subject to us in your name!\" And he said to them\, \"I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. Behold\, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions\, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall hurt you. Nevertheless do not rejoice in this\, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.\" In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said\, \"I thank you\, Father\, Lord of heaven and earth\, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes; yes\, Father\, for such was your gracious will.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:The Forefeast of the Nativity of the Theotokos

But we impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God\, which God decreed before the ages for our glorification. None of the rulers of this age understood this; for if they had\, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. But\, as it is written\, \"What no eye has seen\, nor ear heard\, nor the heart of man conceived\, what God has prepared for those who love him.\"\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 10:37-42\, 11:1\nThe Lord said\, \"He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; and he who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. He who finds his life will lose it\, and he who loses his life for my sake will find it. He who receives you receives me\, and he who receives me receives him who sent me. He who receives a prophet because he is a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward\, and he who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. And whoever gives to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple\, truly\, I say to you\, he shall not lose his reward.\" And when Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples\, he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities.\n\n

SUMMARY:Sunday before Holy Cross
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 09/08/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Sunday before Holy Cross; The Nativity of Our Most Holy Lady the Theotokos and Ever-Virgin Mary; Sophronios\, Bishop of Iberia\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Luke 1:39-49\, 56\nIn those days\, Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country\, to a city of Judah\, and she entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth. And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary\, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and she exclaimed with a loud cry\, \"Blessed are you among women\, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why is this granted me\, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold\, when the voice of your greeting came to my ears\, the babe in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.\"\n\n  And Mary said\, \"My soul magnifies the Lord\, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior\, for he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden. For behold\, henceforth all generations will call me blessed; for he who is mighty has done great things for me\, and holy is his name.\" And Mary remained with her about three months\, and returned to her home.\n\nEpistle Reading: Galatians 6:11-18\nBrethren\, see with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand. It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh that would compel you to be circumcised\, and only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. For even those who receive circumcision do not themselves keep the law\, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh. But far be it from me to glory except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ\, by which the world has been crucified to me\, and I to the world. For neither circumcision counts for anything\, nor uncircumcision\, but a new creation. Peace and mercy be upon all who walk by this rule\, upon the Israel of God. Henceforth let no man trouble me; for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit\, brethren. Amen.\n\nGospel Reading: John 3:13-17\nThe Lord said\, \"No one has ascended into heaven but he who descended from heaven\, the Son of man who is in heaven. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness\, so must the Son of man be lifted up\, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.\n\n\"For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son\, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God sent the Son into the world\, not to condemn the world\, but that the world might be saved through him.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:The Holy & Righteous Ancestors of God\, Joachim and Anna
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 09/09/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: The Holy & Righteous Ancestors of God\, Joachim and Anna; Severian the Martyr of Sebastia; Theophanes the Confessor; Afterfeast of the Nativity of the Theotokos; Memory of the Third Holy Ecumenical Council in Ephesus\n\nEpistle Reading: Galatians 4:22-27\nBrethren\, Abraham had two sons\, one by a slave and one by a free woman. But the son of the slave was born according to the flesh\, the son of the free woman through promise. Now this is an allegory: these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai\, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar. Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; she corresponds to the present Jerusalem\, for she is in slavery with her children. But the Jerusalem above is free\, and she is our mother. For it is written\, \"Rejoice\, O barren one who does not bear; break forth and shout\, you who are not in travail; for the children of the desolate one are many more than the children of her that is married.\"\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 8:16-21\nThe Lord said\, \"No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a vessel\, or puts it under a bed\, but puts it on a stand\, that those who enter may see the light. For nothing is hid that shall not be made manifest\, nor anything secret that shall not be known and come to light. Take heed then how you hear; for to him who has will more be given\, and from him who has not\, even what he thinks that he has will be taken away.\"\n\nThen his mother and his brothers came to him\, but they could not reach him for the crowd. And he was told\, \"Your mother and your brothers are standing outside\, desiring to see you.\" But he said to them\, \"My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.\"\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 09/10/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Menodora\, Metrodora\, & Nymphodora the Martyrs; Poulcheria the Empress; Afterfeast of the Nativity of the Theotokos\n\nEpistle Reading: II Corinthians 5:15-21\nBrethren\, Christ died for all\, that those who live might live no longer for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised.\n\nFrom now on\, therefore\, we regard no one from a human point of view; even though we once regarded Christ from a human point of view\, we regard him thus no longer. Therefore\, if any one is in Christ\, he is a new creation; the old has passed away\, behold\, the new has come. All this is from God\, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation; that is\, God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself\, not counting their trespasses against them\, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation. So we are ambassadors for Christ\, God making his appeal through us. We beseech you on behalf of Christ\, be reconciled to God. For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin\, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.\n\nGospel Reading: John 3:16-21\nThe Lord said to his disciples: \"God so loved the world that he gave his only Son\, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God sent the Son into the world\, not to condemn the world\, but that the world might be saved through him. He who believes in him is not condemned; he who does not believe is condemned already\, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment\, that the light has come into the world\, and men loved darkness rather than light\, because their deeds were evil. For every one who does evil hates the light\, and does not come to the light\, lest his deeds should be exposed. But he who does what is true comes to the light\, that it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been wrought in God.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Theodora of Alexandria
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 09/11/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Theodora of Alexandria; Euphrosynos the Cook; Demetrios & Evanthea the Martyrs & their son Demetrianos; Sergius and Herman of Valaam\, Finland; Afterfeast of the Nativity of the Theotokos; Deinol the First Bishop of Bangor\n\nStrict Fast\n\nEpistle Reading: II Corinthians 6:11-16\nBrethren\, our mouth is open to you\, Corinthians; our heart is wide. You are not restricted by us\, but you are restricted in your own affections. In return -- I speak as to children -- widen your hearts also.\n\nDo not be mismated with unbelievers. For what partnership have righteousness and iniquity? Or what fellowship has light with darkness? What accord has Christ with Belial? Or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever? What agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God\, as God said.\n\nGospel Reading: John 12:19-36\nAt that time\, the Pharisees took counsel against Jesus and said to one another\, \"You see that you can do nothing; look\, the world has gone after him.\"\n\nNow among those who went up to worship at the feast were some Greeks. So these came to Philip\, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee\, and said to him\, \"Sir\, we wish to see Jesus.\" Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew went with Philip and they told Jesus. And Jesus answered them\, \"The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified. Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies\, it remains alone; but if it dies\, it bears much fruit. He who loves his life loses it\, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. If any one serves me\, he must follow me; and where I am\, there shall my servant be also; if any one serves me\, the Father will honor him.\n\n\"Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? 'Father\, save me from this hour?' No\, for this purpose I have come to this hour. Father\, glorify your name.\" Then a voice came from heaven\, \"I have glorified it\, and I will glorify it again.\" The crowd standing by heard it and said that it had thundered. Others said\, \"An angel has spoken to him.\" Jesus answered\, \"This voice has come for your sake\, not for mine. Now is the judgment of this world\, now shall the ruler of this world be cast out; and I\, when I am lifted up from the earth\, will draw all men to myself.\" He said this to show by what death he was to die. The crowd answered him\, \"We have heard from the law that the Christ remains for ever. How can you say that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?\" Jesus said to them\, \"The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light\, lest the darkness overtake you; he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes. While you have the light\, believe in the light\, that you may become sons of light.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Apodosis of the Nativity of Our Most Holy Lady the Theotokos and Ever-Virgin Mary
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 09/12/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Apodosis of the Nativity of Our Most Holy Lady the Theotokos and Ever-Virgin Mary; Autonomos the Martyr; Hieromartyr Cornatus\, Bishop of Iconium; Agirus\, the Hieromartyr of Cornoutus\, Bishop of Iconium; Daniel of Thassos; Julian the Martyr; Theodore the Hieromartyr of Alexandria\n\nEpistle Reading: II Corinthians 7:1-10\nBrethren\, let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit\, and make holiness perfect in the fear of God.\n\nOpen your hearts to us; we have wronged no one\, we have corrupted no one\, we have taken advantage of no one. I do not say this to condemn you\, for I said before that you are in our hearts\, to die together and to live together. I have great confidence in you; I have great pride in you; I am filled with comfort. With all our affliction\, I am overjoyed.\n\nFor even when we came into Macedonia\, our bodies had no rest but we were afflicted at every turn --fighting without and fear within. But God\, who comforts the downcast\, comforted us by the coming of Titus\, and not only by his coming but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you\, as he told us of your longing\, your mourning\, your zeal for me\, so that I rejoiced still more. For even if I made you sorry with my letter\, I do not regret it (though I did regret it)\, for I see that that letter grieved you\, though only for a while. As it is\, I rejoice\, not because you were grieved\, but because you were grieved into repenting; for you felt a godly grief\, so that you suffered no loss through us. For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation and brings no regret\, but worldly grief produces death.\n\nGospel Reading: John 11:47-54\nAt that time\, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the council\, and said\, \"What are we to do? For this man performs many signs. If we let him go on thus\, every one will believe in him\, and the Romans will come and destroy both our place and our nation.\" But one of them\, Caiaphas\, who was high priest that year\, said to them\, \"You know nothing at all; you do not understand that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people\, and that the whole nation should not perish.\" He did not say this of his own accord\, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation\, and not for the nation only\, but to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad. So from that day on they took counsel how to put him to death.\n\nJesus therefore no longer went about openly among the Jews\, but went from there to the country near the wilderness\, to a town called Ephraim; and there he stayed with the disciples.\n\n

He was faithful to him who appointed him\, just as Moses also was faithful in all God's house. Yet Jesus has been counted worthy of as much more glory than Moses as the builder of a house has more honor than the house. (For every house is built by some one\, but the builder of all things is God.)\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 16:13-19\nAt that time\, when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi\, he asked his disciples\, \"Who do men say that the Son of man is?\" And they said\, \"Some say John the Baptist\, others say Elijah\, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.\" He said to them\, \"But who do you say that I am?\" Simon Peter replied\, \"You are the Christ\, the Son of the living God.\" And Jesus answered him\, \"Blessed are you\, Simon Bar Jona! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you\, but my Father who is in heaven. And I tell you\, you are Peter\, and on this rock I will build my church\, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven\, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven\, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:The Elevation of the Venerable and Life-Giving Cross
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 09/14/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: The Elevation of the Venerable and Life-Giving Cross; Commemoration of the 6th Ecumenical Council\n\nFast Day (Wine and Oil Allowed)\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: John 12:28-36\nThe Lord said\, \"Father\, glorify your name.\" Then a voice came from heaven\, \"I have glorified it\, and I will glorify it again.\" The crowd standing by heard it and said that it had thundered. Others said\, \"An angel has spoken to him.\" Jesus answered\, \"This voice has come for your sake\, not for mine. Now is the judgment of this world\, now shall the ruler of this world be cast out: and I\, when I am lifted up from the earth\, will draw all men to myself.\" He said this to show by what death he was to die. The crowd answered him\, \"We have heard from the law that the Christ remains for ever. How can you say that the Son of man must be lifted up?

Walk while you have the light\, lest the darkness overtake you; he who walks in darkness does not know where he goes. While you have the light\, believe in the light\, that you may become sons of light.\"\n\nEpistle Reading: I Corinthians 1:18-24\nBrethren\, the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing\, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. For it is written\, \"I will destroy the wisdom of the wise\, and the cleverness of the clever I will thwart.\" Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since\, in the wisdom of God\, the world did not know God through wisdom\, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe. For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom\, but we preach Christ crucified\, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles\, but to those who are called\, both Jews and Greeks\, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.\n\nGospel Reading: John 19:6-11\, 13-20\, 25-28\, 30\nAt that time\, when the chief priests and the officers saw him\, they cried out\, \"Crucify him\, crucify him!\" Pilate said to them\, \"Take him yourselves and crucify him\, for I find no crime in him.\" The Jews answered him\, \"We have a law\, and by that law he ought to die\, because he has made himself the Son of God.\"\n\nWhen Pilate heard these words\, he was the more afraid; he entered the praetorium again and said to Jesus\, \"Where are you from?\" But Jesus gave no answer. Pilate therefore said to him\, \"You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you\, and power to crucify you?\" Jesus answered him\, \"You would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above; therefore he who delivered me to you has the greater sin.\" When Pilate heard these words\, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called the Pavement\, and in Hebrew\, Gabbatha. Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews\, \"Behold your King!\" They cried out\, \"Away with him\, away with him\, crucify him!\" Pilate said to them\, \"Shall I crucify your King?\" The chief priests answered\, \"We have no king but Caesar.\" Then he handed him over to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus\, and he went out\, bearing his own cross\, to the place called the place of a skull\, which is called in Hebrew Golgotha. There they crucified him\, and with him two others\, one on either side\, and Jesus between them. Pilate also wrote a title and put it on the cross; it read\, \"Jesus of Nazareth\, the King of the Jews.\" Many of the Jews read this title\, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew\, in Latin\, and in Greek.\n\nBut standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother\, and his mother's sister\, Mary the wife of Clopas\, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother\, and the disciple whom he loved standing near\, he said to his mother\, \"Woman\, behold your son!\" Then he said to the disciple\, \"Behold your mother!\" And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home. Then when Jesus had received the vinegar\, he said\, \"It is finished\"; and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.\n\n

And when they saw Him they worshiped Him; but some doubted. And Jesus came and said to them\, \"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations\, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit\, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo\, I am with you always\, to the close of the age. Amen.\"\n\nEpistle Reading: Galatians 2:16-20\nBrethren\, knowing that a man is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ\, even we have believed in Christ Jesus\, in order to be justified by faith in Christ\, and not by works of the law\, because by works of the law shall no one be justified. But if\, in our endeavor to be justified in Christ\, we ourselves were found to be sinners\, is Christ then an agent of sin? Certainly not! But if I build up again those things which I tore down\, then I prove myself a transgressor. For I through the law died to the law\, that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live\, but Christ who lives in me; and the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God\, who loved me and gave himself for me.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 8:34-38; 9:1\nThe Lord said: \"If anyone wishes to come after me\, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel's will save it. For what does it profit a man\, to gain the whole world and forfeit his life? For what can a man give in return for his life? For whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation\, of him will the Son of man also be ashamed\, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.\" And he said to them\, \"Truly\, I say to you\, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God come with power.\"\n\n

For he says\, \"At the acceptable time I have listened to you\, and helped you on the day of salvation.\" Behold\, now is the acceptable time; behold\, now is the day of salvation. We put no obstacle in any one's way\, so that no fault may be found with our ministry\, but as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: through great endurance\, in afflictions\, hardships\, calamities\, beatings\, imprisonments\, tumults\, labors\, watching\, hunger; by purity\, knowledge\, forbearance\, kindness\, the Holy Spirit\, genuine love\, truthful speech\, and the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left; in honor and dishonor\, in ill repute and good repute. We are treated as impostors\, and yet are true; as unknown\, and yet well known; as dying\, and behold we live; as punished\, and yet not killed; as sorrowful\, yet always rejoicing; as poor\, yet making many rich; as having nothing\, and yet possessing everything.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 7:36-50\nAt that time\, one of the Pharisees asked Jesus to eat with him\, and he went into the Pharisee's house\, and took his place at table. And behold\, a woman of the city\, who was a sinner\, when she learned that he was at table in the Pharisee's house\, brought an alabaster flask of ointment\, and standing behind him at his feet\, weeping\, she began to wet his feet with her tears\, and wiped them with the hair of her head\, and kissed his feet\, and anointed them with the ointment. Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it\, he said to himself\, \"If this man were a prophet\, he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him\, for she is a sinner.\" And Jesus answering said to him\, \"Simon\, I have something to say to you.\" And he answered\, \"What is it\, Teacher?\" \"A certain creditor had two debtors; one owed five hundred denarii\, and the other fifty. When they could not pay\, he forgave them both. Now which of them will love him more?\" Simon answered\, \"The one\, I suppose\, to whom he forgave more.\" And he said to him\, \"You have judged rightly.\" Then turning toward the woman he said to Simon\, \"Do you see this woman? I entered your house\, you gave me no water for my feet\, but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. You gave me no kiss\, but from the time I came in she has not ceased to kiss my feet. You did not anoint my head with oil\, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. Therefore I tell you\, her sins\, which are many\, are forgiven\, for she loved much; but he who is forgiven little\, loves little.\" And he said to her\, \"Your sins are forgiven.\" Then those who were at table with him began to say among themselves\, \"Who is this\, who even forgives sins?\" And he said to the woman\, \"Your faith has saved you; go in peace.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Sophia & her three daughters: Faith\, Hope\, and Love
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 09/17/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Sophia & her three daughters: Faith\, Hope\, and Love; Herakleides & Myron\, Bishops of Cyprus; Afterfeast of the Holy Cross\n\nEpistle Reading: II Corinthians 8:16-24;9:1-5\nBrethren\, thanks be to God who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus. For he not only accepted our appeal\, but being himself very earnest he is going to you of his own accord. With him we are sending the brother who is famous among all the churches for his preaching of the gospel; and not only that\, but he has been appointed by the churches to travel with us in this gracious work which we are carrying on\, for the glory of the Lord and to show our good will. We intend that no one should blame us about this liberal gift which we are administering\, for we aim at what is honorable not only in the Lord's sight but also in the sight of men. And with them we are sending our brother whom we have often tested and found earnest in many matters\, but who is now more earnest than ever because of his great confidence in you. As for Titus\, he is my partner and fellow worker in your service; and as for our brethren\, they are apostles of the churches\, the glory of Christ. So give proof\, before the churches\, of your love and of our boasting about you to these men.\n\nNow it is superfluous for me to write to you about the offering for the saints\, for I know your readiness of which I boast about you to the people of Macedonia\, saying that Achaia has been ready since last year; and your zeal has stirred up most of them. But I am sending the brethren so that our boasting about you may not prove vain in this case\, so that you may be ready\, as I said you would be; lest if some Macedonians come with me and find that you are not ready\, we be humiliated -- to say nothing of you -- for being so confident. So I thought it necessary to urge the brethren to go on to you before me\, and arrange in advance for this gift you have promised\, so that it may be ready not as an exaction but as a willing gift.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 3:23-38\, 4:1\nAt that time\, Jesus\, when he began his ministry\, was about thirty years of age\, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph\, the son of Heli\, the son of Matthat\, the son of Levi\, the son of Melchi\, the son of Jannai\, the son of Joseph\, the son of Mattathias\, the son of Amos\, the son of Nahum\, the son of Esli\, the son of Naggai\, the son of Maath\, the son of Mattathias\, the son of Semein\, the son of Josech\, the son of Joda\, the son of Joanan\, the son of Rhesa\, the son of Zerubbabel\, the son of Salathiel\, the son of Neri\, the son of Melchi\, the son of Addi\, the son of Cosam\, the son of Elmadam\, the son of Er\, the son of Joshua\, the son of Eliezer\, the son of Jorim\, the son of Matthat\, the son of Levi\, the son of Simeon\, the son of Judah\, the son of Joseph\, the son of Jonam\, the son of Eliakim\, the son of Melea\, the son of Menna\, the son of Mattatha\, the son of Nathan\, the son of David\, the son of Jesse\, the son of Obed\, the son of Boaz\, the son of Sala\, the son of Nahshon\, the son of Amminadab\, the son of Admin\, the son of Arni\, the son of Hezron\, the son of Perez\, the son of Judah\, the son of Jacob\, the son of Isaac\, the son of Abraham\, the son of Terah\, the son of Nahor\, the son of Serug\, the son of Reu\, the son of Peleg\, the son of Eber\, the son of Shelah\, the son of Cainan\, the son of Arphaxad\, the son of Shem\, the son of Noah\, the son of Lamech\, the son of Methuselah\, the son of Enoch\, the son of Jared\, the son of Mahalaleel\, the son of Cainan\, the son of Enos\, the son of Seth\, the son of Adam\, the son of God.

Under the test of this service\, you will glorify God by your obedience in acknowledging the gospel of Christ\, and by the generosity of your contribution for them and for all others; while they long for you and pray for you\, because of the surpassing grace of God in you. Thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift!\n\nI\, Paul\, myself entreat you\, by the meekness and gentleness of Christ - I who am humble when face to face with you\, but bold to you when I am away! - I beg of you that when I am present I may not have to show boldness with such confidence as I count on showing against some who suspect us of acting in worldly fashion. For though we live in the world we are not carrying on a worldly war\, for the weapons of our warfare are not worldly but have divine power to destroy strongholds. We destroy arguments and every proud obstacle to the knowledge of God\, and take every thought captive to obey Christ\, being ready to punish every disobedience\, when your obedience is complete.\n\nLook at what is before your eyes. If any one is confident that he is Christ's\, let him remind himself that as he is Christ's\, so are we.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 4:1-15\nAt that time Jesus returned from the Jordan\, and was led by the Spirit for forty days in the wilderness\, tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing in those days; and when they were ended\, he was hungry. The devil said to him\, \"If you are the Son of God\, command this stone to become bread.\" And Jesus answered him\, \"It is written\, 'Man shall not live by bread alone.'\" And the devil took him up\, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time\, and said to him\, \"To you I will give all this authority and their glory; for it has been delivered to me\, and I will give it to whom I will. If you\, then\, will worship me\, it shall all be yours.\" And Jesus answered him\, \"It is written\, 'You shall worship the Lord your God\, and him only shall you serve.'\"\n\nAnd he took him to Jerusalem\, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple\, and said to him\, \"If you are the Son of God\, throw yourself down from here; for it is written\, 'He will give his angels charge of you\, to guard you\,' and 'On their hands they will bear you up\, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'\" And Jesus answered him\, \"It is said\, 'You shall not tempt the Lord your God.'\" And when the devil had ended every temptation\, he departed from him until an opportune time. And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee\, and a report concerning him went out through all the surrounding country. And he taught in their synagogues\, being glorified by all.\n\n

For even if I boast a little too much of our authority\, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you\, I shall not be put to shame. I would not seem to be frightening you with letters. For they say\,\"His letters are weighty and strong\, but his bodily presence is weak\, and his speech of no account.\" Let such people understand that what we say by letter when absent\, we do when present. Not that we venture to class or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves. But when they measure themselves by one another\, and compare themselves with one another\, they are without understanding. But we will not boast beyond limit\, but will keep to the limits God has apportioned us\, to reach even to you. For we are not overextending ourselves\, as though we did not reach you; we were the first to come all the way to you with the gospel of Christ. We do not boast beyond limit\, in other men's labors; but our hope is that you may be greatly enlarged\, so that we may preach the gospel in lands beyond you\, without boasting of work already done in another's field. \"Let him who boasts\, boast of the Lord.\" For it is not the man who commends himself that is accepted\, but the man whom the Lord commends.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 4:16-22\nAt that time\, Jesus came to Nazareth\, where he had been brought up; and he went to the synagogue\, as his custom was\, on the sabbath day. And he stood up to read; and there was given to him the book of the prophet Isaiah. He opened the book and found the place where it was written\, \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me\, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind\, to set at liberty those who are oppressed\, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.\" And he closed the book\, and gave it back to the attendant\, and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. And he began to say to them\, \"Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.\" And all spoke well of him\, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth.\n\n

For we are not contending against flesh and blood\, but against the principalities\, against the powers\, against the world rulers of this present darkness\, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.

And take the helmet of salvation\, and the sword of the Spirit\, which is the word of God.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 21:12-19\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"Beware of men who will lay their hands on you and persecute you\, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons\, and you will be brought before kings and governors for my name's sake. This will be a time for you to bear testimony. Settle it therefore in your minds\, not to meditate beforehand how to answer; for I will give you a mouth and wisdom\, which none of your adversaries will be able to withstand or contradict.

And I was with you in weakness and in much fear and trembling; and my speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom\, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power\, that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.\n\nGospel Reading: John 8:21-30\nThe Lord said to the Jews who came to him\, \"I go away\, and you will seek me and die in your sin; where I am going\, you cannot come.\" Then said the Jews\, \"Will he kill himself\, since he says\, 'Where I am going\, you cannot come'? \" He said to them\, \"You are from below\, I am from above; you are of this world\, I am not of this world. I told you that you would die in your sins\, for you will die in your sins unless you believe that I am he.\" They said to him\, \"Who are you?\" Jesus said to them\, \"Even what I have told you from the beginning. I have much to say about you and much to judge; but he who sent me is true\, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.\" They did not understand that he spoke to them of the Father. So Jesus said\, \"When you have lifted up the Son of man\, then you will know that I am he\, and that I do nothing on my own authority but speak thus as the Father taught me. And he who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone\, for I always do what is pleasing to him.\" As he spoke thus\, many believed in him.\n\n

And very early on the first day of the week they went to the tomb when the sun had risen. And they were saying to one another\, \"Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the tomb?\" And looking up\, they saw that the stone was rolled back - it was very large. And entering the tomb\, they saw a young man sitting on the right side\, dressed in a white robe; and they were amazed. And he said to them\, \"Do not be amazed; you seek Jesus of Nazareth\, who was crucified. He has risen\, He is not here; see the place where they laid Him. But go\, tell His disciples and Peter that He is going before you to Galilee; there you will see Him\, as He told you.\" And they went out and fled from the tomb\, for trembling and astonishment had come upon them; and they said nothing to anyone\, for they were afraid.\n\nEpistle Reading: I Corinthians 16:13-24\nBrethren\, be watchful\, stand firm in your faith\, be courageous\, be strong. Let all that you do be done in love. Now\, brethren\, you know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia\, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints; I urge you to be subject to such men and to every fellow worker and laborer. I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicos\, because they have made up for your absence; for they refreshed my spirit as well as yours. Give recognition to such men. The churches of Asia send greetings. Aquila and Prisca\, together with the church in their house\, send you hearty greetings in the Lord. All the brethren send greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss. I\, Paul\, write this greeting with my own hand. If any one has no love for the Lord\, let him be accursed. Our Lord\, come! The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 5:1-11\nAt that time\, as Jesus was standing by the lake of Gennesaret\, he saw two boats by the lake; but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets. Getting into one of the boats\, which was Simon's\, he asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the people from the boat. And when he had ceased speaking\, he said to Simon\, \"Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.\" And Simon answered\, \"Master\, we toiled all night and took nothing! But at your word I will let down the nets.\" And when they had done this\, they enclosed a great shoal of fish; and as their nets were breaking\, they beckoned to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats\, so that they began to sink. But when Simon Peter saw it\, he fell down at Jesus' knees\, saying\, \"Depart from me\, for I am a sinful man\, O Lord.\" For he was astonished\, and all who were with him\, at the catch of fish which they had taken; and so also were James and John\, sons of Zebedee\, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon\, \"Do not be afraid; henceforth you will be catching men.\" And when they had brought their boats to land\, they left everything and followed him.\n\n

SUMMARY:The Conception of St. John the Baptist
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 09/23/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: The Conception of St. John the Baptist; Xanthippe & Polyxene the Righteous; John the New Martyr of Epiros; Nicholas the New Martyr\n\nEpistle Reading: Galatians 4:22-27\nBrethren\, Abraham had two sons\, one by a slave and one by a free woman. But the son of the slave was born according to the flesh\, the son of the free woman through promise. Now this is an allegory: these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai\, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar. Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; she corresponds to the present Jerusalem\, for she is in slavery with her children. But the Jerusalem above is free\, and she is our mother. For it is written\, \"Rejoice\, O barren one who does not bear; break forth and shout\, you who are not in travail; for the children of the desolate one are many more than the children of her that is married.\"\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 1:5-25\nAt that time\, in the days of Herod\, king of Judea\, there was a priest named Zacharias\, of the division of Abijah; and he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron\, and her name was Elizabeth. And they were both righteous before God\, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless. But they had no child\, because Elizabeth was barren\, and both were advanced in years.\n\nNow while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty\, according to the custom of the priesthood\, it fell to him by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense. And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense. And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.\n\nAnd Zacharias was troubled when he saw him\, and fear fell upon him. But the angel said to him\, \"Do not be afraid\, Zacharias\, for your prayer is heard\, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son\, and you shall call his name John.\n\nAnd you will have joy and gladness\, and many will rejoice at his birth; for he will be great before the Lord\, and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink\, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit\, even from his mother's womb. And he will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God\, and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah\, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children\, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just\, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.\" And Zacharias said to the angel\, \"How shall I know this? For I am an old man\, and my wife is advanced in years.\" And the angel answered him\, \"I am Gabriel\, who stands in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak to you\, and to bring you this good news. And behold\, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things come to pass\, because you did not believe my words\, which will be fulfilled in their time.\" And the people were waiting for Zacharias\, and they wondered at his delay in the temple. And when he came out\, he could not speak to them\, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he made signs to them and remained dumb. And when his time of service was ended\, he went to his home.\n\nAfter these days his wife Elizabeth conceived\, and for five months she hid herself\, saying\, \"Thus the Lord has done to me in the days when he looked on me\, to take away my reproach among men.\"\n\n

And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary\, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and she exclaimed with a loud cry\, \"Blessed are you among women\, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why is this granted me\, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold\, when the voice of your greeting came to my ears\, the babe in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.\"\n\n  And Mary said\, \"My soul magnifies the Lord\, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior\, for he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden. For behold\, henceforth all generations will call me blessed; for he who is mighty has done great things for me\, and holy is his name.\" And Mary remained with her about three months\, and returned to her home.\n\nEpistle Reading: II Timothy 3:10-15\nTIMOTHY\, my son\, you have observed my teaching\, my conduct\, my aim in life\, my faith\, my patience\, my love\, my steadfastness\, my persecutions\, my sufferings\, what befell me at Antioch\, at lconion\, and at Lystra\, what persecutions I endured; yet from them all the Lord rescued me. Indeed all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted\, while evil men and impostors will go on from bad to worse\, deceivers and deceived. But as for you\, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed\, knowing from whom you learned it and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings which are able to instruct you for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 10:38-42\, 11:27-28\nAt that time\, Jesus entered a village; and a woman called Martha received him into her house. And she had a sister called Mary\, who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his teaching. But Martha was distracted with much serving; and she went to him and said\, \"Lord\, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve you alone? Tell her then to help me.\" But the Lord answered her\, \"Martha\, Martha\, you are anxious and troubled about many things; one thing is needful. Mary has chosen the good portion\, which shall not be taken away from her.\" As he said this\, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him\, \"Blessed is the womb that bore you\, and the breasts that you sucked!\" But he said\, \"Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it!\"\n\n

For he was crucified in weakness\, but lives by the power of God. For we are weak in him\, but in dealing with you we shall live with him by the power of God.\n\nExamine yourselves\, to see whether you are holding to your faith. Test yourselves. Do you not realize that Jesus Christ is in you? - unless indeed you fail to meet the test! I hope you will find out that we have not failed. But we pray God that you may not do wrong - not that we may appear to have met the test\, but that you may do what is right\, though we may seem to have failed. For we cannot do anything against the truth\, but only for the truth. For we are glad when we are weak and you are strong. What we pray for is your improvement. I write this while I am away from you\, in order that when I come I may not have to be severe in my use of the authority which the Lord has given me for building up and not for tearing down.\n\nFinally\, brethren\, farewell. Mend your ways\, heed my appeal\, agree with one another\, live in peace\, and the God of love and peace will be with you. Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the saints greet you.\n\nThe grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 5:33-39\nAt that time\, the Pharisees came to Jesus and said to him\, \"Why do the disciples of John fast often and offer prayers\, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees\, but yours eat and drink?\" And Jesus said to them\, \"Can you make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? The days will come\, when the bridegroom is taken away from them\, and then they will fast in those days.\" He told them a parable also: \"No one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it upon an old garment; if he does\, he will tear the new\, and the piece from the new will not match the old. And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does\, the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled\, and the skins will be destroyed. But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins. And no one after drinking old wine desires new; for he says\, 'The old is better.'\"\n\n

SUMMARY:The Falling Asleep of St. John the Evangelist and Theologian
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 09/26/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: The Falling Asleep of St. John the Evangelist and Theologian; Removal of the Honorable Head of Apostle Andrew the First-Called\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: John 21:14-25\nAt that time\, Jesus revealed himself to the disciples after he was raised from the dead. And he said to Simon Peter\, \"Simon\, son of John\, do you love me more than these?\" He said to him\, \"Yes\, Lord; you know that I love you.\" He said to him\, \"Feed my lambs.\" A second time he said to him\, \"Simon\, son of John\, do you love me?\" He said to him\, \"Yes\, Lord; you know that I love you.\" He said to him\, \"Tend my sheep.\" He said to him the third time\, \"Simon\, son of John\, do you love me?\" Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time\, \"Do you love me?\" And he said to him\, \"Lord\, you know everything; you know that I love you.\" Jesus said to him\, \"Feed my sheep. Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, when you were young\, you girded yourself and walked where you would; but when you are old\, you will stretch out your hands\, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go.\" (This he said to show by what death he was to glorify God.) And after this he said to him\, \"Follow me.\" Peter turned and saw following them the disciple whom Jesus loved\, who had lain close to his breast at the supper and had said\, \"Lord\, who is it that is going to betray you?\" When Peter saw him\, he said to Jesus\, \"Lord\, what about this man?\" Jesus said to him\, \"If it is my will that he remain until I come\, what is that to you? Follow me!\" The saying spread abroad among the brethren that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die\, but\, \"If it is my will that he remain until I come\, what is that to you?\" This is the disciple who is bearing witness to these things\, and who has written these things; and we know that his testimony is true. But there are also many other things which Jesus did; were every one of them to be written\, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen.\n\nEpistle Reading: I John 4:12-19\nNo man has ever seen God; if we love one another\, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us. By this we know that we abide in him and he in us\, because he has given us of his own Spirit. And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son as the Savior of the world. Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God\, God abides in him\, and he in God. So we know and believe the love God has for us. God is love\, and he who abides in love abides in God\, and God abides in him. In this is love perfected with us\, that we may have confidence for the day of judgment\, because as he is so are we in this world. There is no fear in love\, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment\, and he who fears is not perfected in love. We love\, because he first loved us.\n\nGospel Reading: John 19:25-27; 21:24-25\nAt that time\, standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother\, and his mother's sister\, Mary the wife of Clopas\, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother\, and the disciple whom he loved standing near\, he said to his mother\, \"Woman\, behold\, your son!\" Then he said to the disciple\, \"Behold\, your mother!\" And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home. This is the disciple who is bearing witness to these things\, and who has written these things; and we know that his testimony is true. But there are also many other things which Jesus did; were every one of them to be written\, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.\n\n

And all the crowd sought to touch him\, for power came forth from him and healed them all.  And he lifted up his eyes on His disciples\, and said: \"Blessed are you poor\, for yours is the Kingdom of God.  Blessed are you that hunger now\, for you shall be satisfied.  Blessed are you that weep now\, for you shall laugh.  Blessed are you when men hate you\, and when they exclude you and revile you\, and cast out your name as evil\, on account of the Son of man!  Rejoice in that day\, and leap for joy\, for behold\, your reward is great in heaven.\"\n\n

We are afflicted in every way\, but not crushed; perplexed\, but not driven to despair; persecuted\, but not forsaken; struck down\, but not destroyed; always carrying in the body the death of Jesus\, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies.  For while we live we are always being given up to death for Jesus' sake\, so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.  So death is at work in us\, but life in you.\n\nSince we have the same spirit of faith as he had who wrote\, \"I believed\, and so I spoke\,\" we too believe\, and so we speak\, knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence.  For it is all for your sake\, so that as grace extends to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving\, to the glory of God.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 6:17-23\nAt that time\, Jesus stood on a level place\, with a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon\, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured.

She went and told those who had been with Him\, as they mourned and wept. But when they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her\, they would not believe it.\n\nAfter this he appeared in another form to two of them\, as they were walking into the country. And they went back and told the rest\, but they did not believe them. After this He appeared to the eleven themselves as they sat at table and He upbraided them for their unbelief and hardness of heart\, because they had not believed those who saw Him after He had risen. And He said to them\, \"Go into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation. He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned. And these signs will accompany those who believe: in My name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents\, and if they drink any deadly thing\, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick\, and they will recover.\"\n\nSo then the Lord Jesus\, after He had spoken to them\, was taken up into heaven\, and sat down at the right hand of God. And they went forth and preached everywhere\, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that attended it. Amen.\n\nEpistle Reading: II Corinthians 1:21-24;2:1-4\nBrethren\, it is God who establishes us with you in Christ\, and has commissioned us; he has put his seal upon us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.\n\nBut I call God to witness against me - it was to spare you that I refrained from coming to Corinth. Not that we lord it over your faith; we work with you for your joy\, for you stand firm in your faith. For I made up my mind not to make you another painful visit. For if I cause you pain\, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained? And I wrote as I did\, so that when I came I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice\, for I felt sure of all of you\, that my joy would be the joy of you all. For I wrote you out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears\, not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 6:31-36\nThe Lord said\, \"As you wish that men would do to you\, do so to them. If you love those who love you\, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. And if you do good to those who do good to you\, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive\, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners\, to receive as much again. But love your enemies\, and do good\, and lend\, expecting nothing in return; and your reward will be great\, and you will be sons of the Most High; for he is kind to the ungrateful and the selfish. Be merciful\, even as your Father is merciful.\"\n\n

The Lord said to him in a vision\, \"Ananias.\" And he said\, \"Here I am\, Lord.\" And the Lord said to him\, \"Rise and go to the street called Straight\, and inquire in the house of Judas for a man of Tarsus named Saul; for behold\, he is praying\, and he has seen a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.\" But Ananias answered\, \"Lord\, I have heard from many about this man\, how much evil he has done to thy saints at Jerusalem; and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call upon thy name.\" But the Lord said to him\, \"Go\, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel; for I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.\" So Ananias departed and entered the house. And laying his hands on him he said\, \"Brother Saul\, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came\, has sent me that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.\" And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes and he regained his sight. Then he rose and was baptized\, and took food and was strengthened.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 6:37-45\nThe Lord said\, \"Judge not\, and you will not be judged; condemn not\, and you will not be condemned; forgive\, and you will be forgiven; give\, and it will be given to you; good measure\, pressed down\, shaken together\, running over\, will be put into your lap. For the measure you give will be the measure you get back.\"\n\nHe also told them a parable: \"Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit? A disciple is not above his teacher\, but every one when he is fully taught will be like his teacher. Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye\, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother\, 'Brother\, let me take out the speck that is in your eye\,' when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite\, first take the log out of your own eye\, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother's eye.\n\n\"For no good tree bears bad fruit\, nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit; for each tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thorns\, nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush. The good man out of the good treasure of his heart produces good\, and the evil man out of his evil treasure produces evil; for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:The Holy Hieromartyr Cyprian and the Virgin Martyr Justina
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 10/02/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: The Holy Hieromartyr Cyprian and the Virgin Martyr Justina; Theophilus the Confessor\n\nStrict Fast\n\nEpistle Reading: I Timothy 1:12-17\nTimothy\, my son\, I thank him who has given me strength for this\, Christ Jesus our Lord\, because he judged me faithful by appointing me to his service\, though I formerly blasphemed and persecuted and insulted him; but I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief\, and the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. The saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance\, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. And I am the foremost of sinners; but I received mercy for this reason\, that in me\, as the foremost\, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience for an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life. To the King of ages\, immortal\, invisible\, the only God\, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 6:46-49\, 7:1\nThe Lord said\, \"Why do you call me 'Lord\, Lord\,' and not do what I tell you? Every one who comes to me and hears my words and does them\, I will show you what he is like: he is like a man building a house\, who dug deep\, and laid the foundation upon rock; and when a flood arose\, the stream broke against that house\, and could not shake it\, because it had been founded upon the rock. But he who hears and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation; against which the stream broke\, and immediately it fell\, and the ruin of that house was great.\" After he had ended all his sayings in the hearing of the people he entered Capernaum.\n\n

SUMMARY:Dionysios the Areopagite
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 10/03/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Dionysios the Areopagite; Rusticus and Eleutherios the Martyrs; John the Chozebite\, Bishop of Caesaria\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 17:16-34\nIn those days\, while Paul was waiting for them in Athens\, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw that the city was full of idols. So he argued in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons\, and in the market place every day with those who chanced to be there. Some also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers met him. And some said\, \"What would this babbler say?\" Others said\, \"He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities\" - because he preached Jesus and the resurrection. And they took hold of him and brought him to the Areopagos\, saying\, \"May we know what this new teaching is which you present? For you bring some strange things to our ears; we wish to know therefore what these things mean.\" Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new. So Paul\, standing in the middle of the Areopagos\, said: \"Men of Athens\, I perceive that in every way you are very religious. For as I passed along\, and observed the objects of your worship\, I found also an altar with this inscription\, 'To an unknown god.' What therefore you worship as unknown\, this I proclaim to you. The God who made the world and everything in it\, being Lord of heaven and earth\, does not live in shrines made by man\, nor is he served by human hands\, as though he needed anything\, since he himself gives to all men life and breath and everything. And he made from one every nation of men to live on all the face of the earth\, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their habitation\, that they should seek God\, in the hope that they might feel after him and find him. Yet he is not far from each one of us\, for 'In him we live and move and have our being'; as even some of your poets have said\, 'For we are indeed his offspring.' Being then God's offspring\, we ought not to think that the Deity is like gold\, or silver\, or stone\, a representation by the art and imagination of man. The times of ignorance God overlooked\, but now he commands all men everywhere to repent\, because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed\, and of this he has given assurance to all men by raising him from the dead.\" Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead\, some mocked; but others said\, \"We will hear you again about this.\" So Paul went out from among them. But some men joined him and believed\, among them Dionysios the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 7:17-30\nAt that time\, the report concerning Jesus spread through the whole of Judea and all the surrounding country. The disciples of John told him of all these things. And John\, calling to him two of his disciples\, sent them to the Lord\, saying\, \"Are you he who is to come\, or shall we look for another?\" And when the men had come to him\, they said\, \"John the Baptist has sent us to you\, saying\, 'Are you he who is to come\, or shall we look for another?'\" In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits\, and on many that were blind he bestowed sight. And he answered them\, \"Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight\, the lame walk\, lepers are cleansed\, and the deaf hear\, the dead are raised up\, the poor have good news preached to them. And blessed is he who takes no offense at me.\"\n\nWhen the messengers of John had gone\, he began to speak to the crowds concerning John: \"What did you go out into the wilderness to behold? A reed shaken by the wind? What then did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold\, those who are gorgeously appareled and live in luxury are in kings' courts. What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes\, I tell you\, and more than a prophet. This is he of whom it is written\, 'Behold\, I send my messenger before your face\, who shall prepare your way before you.' I tell you\, among those born of women none is greater than John; yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\" When they heard this all the people and the tax collectors justified God\, having been baptized with the baptism of John; but the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the purpose of God for themselves\, not having been baptized by him.\n\n

SUMMARY:Hierotheus\, Bishop of Athens
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 10/04/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Hierotheus\, Bishop of Athens; Domnina the Martyr and her daughters; John the Hermit\n\nStrict Fast\n\nEpistle Reading: Galatians 4:8-21\nBrethren\, formerly\, when you did not know God\, you were in bondage to beings that by nature are no gods; but now that you have come to know God\, or rather to be known by God\, how can you turn back again to the weak and beggarly elemental spirits\, whose slaves you want to be once more? You observe days\, and months\, and seasons\, and years! I am afraid I have labored over you in vain. Brethren\, I beseech you\, become as I am\, for I also have become as you are. You did me no wrong; you know it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached the gospel to you at first; and though my condition was a trial to you\, you did not scorn or despise me\, but received me as an angel of God\, as Christ Jesus. What has become of the satisfaction you felt? For I bear you witness that\, if possible\, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me. Have I then become your enemy by telling you the truth? They make much of you\, but for no good purpose; they want to shut you out\, that you may make much of them\, and not only when I am present with you. My little children\, with whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you! I could wish to be present with you now and to change my tone\, for I am perplexed about you. Tell me\, you who desire to be under law\, do you not hear the law?\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 7:31-35\nThe Lord said\, \"To what shall I compare the men of this generation\, and what are they like? They are like children sitting in the market place and calling to one another\, 'We piped to you\, and you did not dance; we wailed\, and you did not weep.' For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine; and you say\, 'He has a demon.' The Son of man has come eating and drinking; and you say\, 'Behold\, a glutton and a drunkard\, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' Yet wisdom is justified by all her children.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Charitina the Martyr
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 10/05/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Charitina the Martyr; Methodia the Righteous of Kimolos; Eudokimos the Unknown of Mount Athos; Peter\, Alexis\, Jonah\, Hermogenes & Tikhon\, Metropolitans of Moscow\n\nEpistle Reading: I Corinthians 4:17-21;5:1-5\nBrethren\, therefore I sent to you Timothy\, my beloved and faithful child in Christ\, as I teach them everywhere in every church. Some are arrogant\, as though I were not coming to you. But I will come to you soon\, if the Lord wills\, and I will find out not the talk of these arrogant people but their power. For the kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power. What do you wish? Shall I come to you with a rod\, or with love in a spirit of gentleness? It is actually reported that there is immorality among you\, and of a kind that is not found even among pagans; for a man is living with his father's wife. And you are arrogant! Ought you not rather to mourn? Let him who has done this be removed from among you. For though absent in body I am present in spirit\, and as if present\, I have already pronounced judgment in the name of the Lord Jesus on the man who has done such a thing. When you are assembled\, and my spirit is present\, with the power of our Lord Jesus\, you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh\, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 5:27-32\nAt that time\, as Jesus passed by\, he saw a tax collector\, named Levi\, sitting at the tax office; and he said to him\, \"Follow me.\" And he left everything\, and rose and followed him. And Levi made him a great feast in his house; and there was a large company of tax collectors and others sitting at table with them. And the Pharisees and their scribes murmured against his disciples\, saying\, \"Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?\" And Jesus answered them\, \"Those who are well have no need of a physician\, but those who are sick; I have not come to call the righteous\, but sinners to repentance.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:3rd Sunday of Luke
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 10/06/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: 3rd Sunday of Luke; The Holy and Glorious Apostle Thomas; Eroteis the Martyr of Cappadocia; Makarios the Righteous of Chios\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Luke 24:1-12\nOn the first day of the week at early dawn\, the women went to the tomb\, taking spices\, which they had prepared. And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb\, but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. While they were perplexed about this\, behold\, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel; and as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground\, the men said to them\, \"Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here\, but has risen. Remember how He told you\, while He was still in Galilee\, that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men\, and be crucified\, and on the third day rise.\" And they remembered His words and returning from the tomb they told all this to the eleven and to all the rest. Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told this to the Apostles; but these words seemed to them an idle tale\, and they did not believe them. But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in\, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home wondering at what had happened.\n\nEpistle Reading: II Corinthians 4:6-15\nBrethren\, it is the God who said\, \"Let light shine out of darkness\,\" who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.\n\nBut we have this treasure in earthen vessels\, to show that the transcendent power belongs to God and not to us.  We are afflicted in every way\, but not crushed; perplexed\, but not driven to despair; persecuted\, but not forsaken; struck down\, but not destroyed; always carrying in the body the death of Jesus\, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies.  For while we live we are always being given up to death for Jesus' sake\, so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.  So death is at work in us\, but life in you.\n\nSince we have the same spirit of faith as he had who wrote\, \"I believed\, and so I spoke\,\" we too believe\, and so we speak\, knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence.  For it is all for your sake\, so that as grace extends to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving\, to the glory of God.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 7:11-16\nAt that time\, Jesus went to a city called Nain\, and his disciples and a great crowd went with him. As he drew near to the gate of the city\, behold\, a man who had died was being carried out\, the only son of his mother\, and she was a widow; and a large crowd from the city was with her. And when the Lord saw her\, he had compassion on her and said to her\, \"Do not weep.\" And he came and touched the bier\, and the bearers stood still. And he said\, \"Young man\, I say to you\, arise.\" And the dead man sat up\, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother. Fear seized them all; and they glorified God\, saying\, \"A great prophet has arisen among us!\" and \"God has visited his people!\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Sergius & Bacchus the Great Martyrs of Syria
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 10/07/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Sergius & Bacchus the Great Martyrs of Syria; Polychronios the Martyr; Julian the Presbyter & Caesarius the Deacon; John the Hermit of Crete; Jonah of Manchuria\n\nEpistle Reading: Galatians 4:28-31;5:1-10\nBrethren\, we\, like Isaac\, are children of promise. But as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit\, so it is now. But what does the scripture say? \"Cast out the slave and her son; for the son of the slave shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.\" So\, brethren\, we are not children of the slave but of the free woman. For freedom Christ has set us free; stand fast therefore\, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery. Now I\, Paul\, say to you that if you receive circumcision\, Christ will be of no advantage to you. I testify again to every man who receives circumcision that he is bound to keep the whole law. You are severed from Christ\, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace. For through the Spirit\, by faith\, we wait for the hope of righteousness. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any avail\, but faith working through love. You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the truth? This persuasion is not from him who calls you. A little leaven leavens the whole lump. I have confidence in the Lord that you will take no other view than mine; and he who is troubling you will bear his judgment\, whoever he is.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 7:36-50\nAt that time\, one of the Pharisees asked Jesus to eat with him\, and he went into the Pharisee's house\, and took his place at table. And behold\, a woman of the city\, who was a sinner\, when she learned that he was at table in the Pharisee's house\, brought an alabaster flask of ointment\, and standing behind him at his feet\, weeping\, she began to wet his feet with her tears\, and wiped them with the hair of her head\, and kissed his feet\, and anointed them with the ointment. Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it\, he said to himself\, \"If this man were a prophet\, he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him\, for she is a sinner.\" And Jesus answering said to him\, \"Simon\, I have something to say to you.\" And he answered\, \"What is it\, Teacher?\" \"A certain creditor had two debtors; one owed five hundred denarii\, and the other fifty. When they could not pay\, he forgave them both. Now which of them will love him more?\" Simon answered\, \"The one\, I suppose\, to whom he forgave more.\" And he said to him\, \"You have judged rightly.\" Then turning toward the woman he said to Simon\, \"Do you see this woman? I entered your house\, you gave me no water for my feet\, but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. You gave me no kiss\, but from the time I came in she has not ceased to kiss my feet. You did not anoint my head with oil\, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. Therefore I tell you\, her sins\, which are many\, are forgiven\, for she loved much; but he who is forgiven little\, loves little.\" And he said to her\, \"Your sins are forgiven.\" Then those who were at table with him began to say among themselves\, \"Who is this\, who even forgives sins?\" And he said to the woman\, \"Your faith has saved you; go in peace.\"\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 10/08/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Pelagia the Righteous; Pelagia the Virgin-martyr of Antioch; Phillip\, Bishop of Gortyna; Taisia the Harlot of Egypt\n\nEpistle Reading: Galatians 5:11-21\nBrethren\, if I still preach circumcision\, why am I still persecuted? In that case the stumbling block of the cross has been removed. I wish those who unsettle you would mutilate themselves! For you were called to freedom\, brethren; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh\, but through love be servants of one another. For the whole law is fulfilled in one word\, \"You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\" But if you bite and devour one another take heed that you are not consumed by one another. But I say\, walk by the Spirit\, and do not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit\, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh; for these are opposed to each other\, to prevent you from doing what you would. But if you are led by the Spirit you are not under the law. Now the works of the flesh are plain: fornication\, impurity\, licentiousness\, idolatry\, sorcery\, enmity\, strife\, jealousy\, anger\, selfishness\, dissension\, party spirit\, envy\, murder\, drunkenness\, carousing\, and the like. I warn you\, as I warned you before\, that those who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 8:1-3\nAt that time Jesus went on through cities and villages\, preaching and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God. And the twelve were with him\, and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary\, called Magdalene\, from whom seven demons had gone out\, and Joanna\, the wife of Chuza\, Herod's steward\, and Susanna\, and many others\, who provided for him out of their means.\n\n

We are fools for Christ's sake\, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak\, but you are strong. You are held in honor\, but we in disrepute. To the present hour we hunger and thirst\, we are ill-clad and buffeted and homeless\, and we labor\, working with our own hands. When reviled\, we bless; when persecuted\, we endure; when slandered\, we try to conciliate; we have become\, and are now\, as the refuse of the world\, the off-scouring of all things. I do not write this to make you ashamed\, but to admonish you as my beloved children. For though you have countless guides in Christ\, you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel. I urge you\, then\, be imitators of me.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 9:36-38; 10:1-8\nAt that time\, when Jesus saw the crowds\, he had compassion for them\, because they were harassed and helpless\, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples\, \"The harvest is plentiful\, but the laborers are few; pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.\"\n\nAnd he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits\, to cast them out\, and to heal every disease and every infirmity. The names of the twelve apostles are these: first\, Simon\, who is called Peter\, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee\, and John his brother; Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaios\, and Lebbaeos called Thaddaios; Simon the Cananaean\, and Judas Iscariot\, who betrayed him. These twelve Jesus sent out\, charging them\, \"Go nowhere among the Gentiles\, and enter no town of the Samaritans\, but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And preach as you go\, saying\, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.' Heal the sick\, raise the dead\, cleanse lepers\, cast out demons. You received without paying\, give without pay.\"\n\n

Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ\, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places\, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world\, that we should be holy and blameless before him. He destined us in love to be his sons through Jesus Christ\, according to the purpose of his will\, to the praise of his glorious grace which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved. In him we have redemption through his blood\, the forgiveness of our trespasses\, according to the riches of his grace which he lavished upon us in all wisdom and insight the mystery of his will\, according to his purpose.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 9:7-11\nAt that time\, Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by Jesus\, and he was perplexed\, because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead\, by some that Elijah had appeared\, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen. Herod said\, \"John I beheaded; but who is this about whom I hear such things?\" And he sought to see him. On their return the apostles told him what they had done. And he took them and withdrew apart to a city called Bethsaida. When the crowds learned it\, they followed him; and he welcomed them and spoke to them of the kingdom of God\, and cured those who had need of healing.\n\n

And he rose and went. And behold\, an Ethiopian\, a eunuch\, a minister of the Candace\, queen of the Ethiopians\, in charge of all her treasure\, had come to Jerusalem to worship and was returning; seated in his chariot\, he was reading the prophet Isaiah. And the Spirit said to Philip\, \"Go up and join this chariot.\" So Philip ran to him\, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet\, and asked\, \"Do you understand what you are reading?\" And he said\, \"How can I\, unless some one guides me?\" And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. Now the passage of the scripture which he was reading was this: \"As a sheep led to the slaughter or a lamb before its shearer is dumb\, so he opens not his mouth. In his humiliation justice was denied him. Who can describe his generation? For his life is taken up from the earth.\" And the eunuch said to Philip\, \"About whom\, pray\, does the prophet say this\, about himself or about some one else?\" Then Philip opened his mouth\, and beginning with this scripture he told him the good news of Jesus. And as they went along the road they came to some water\, and the eunuch said\, \"See\, here is water! What is to prevent my being baptized?\" And Philip said\, \"If you believe with all your heart\, you may.\" And he replied\, \"I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.\" And he commanded the chariot to stop\, and they both went down into the water\, Philip and the eunuch\, and he baptized him. And when they came up out of the water\, the Spirit of the Lord caught up Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more\, and went on his way rejoicing.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 9:12-18\nAt that time\, the twelve disciples came to Jesus and said to him\, \"Send the crowd away\, to go into the villages and country round about\, to lodge and get provisions; for we are here in a lonely place.\" But he said to them\, \"You give them something to eat.\" They said\, \"We have no more than five loaves and two fish -- unless we are to go and buy food for all these people.\" For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples\, \"Make them sit down in companies\, about fifty each.\" And they did so\, and made them all sit down. And taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven\, and blessed and broke them\, and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd. And all ate and were satisfied. And they took up what was left over\, twelve baskets of broken pieces. Now it happened that as he was praying alone the disciples were with him.\n\n

Let no one seek his own good\, but the good of his neighbor. Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience. For \"the earth is the Lord's\, and everything in it.\" If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go\, eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience. But if some one says to you\, \"This has been offered in sacrifice\,\" then out of consideration for the man who informed you\, and for conscience' sake\, do not eat it. For \"the earth is the Lord's\, and everything in it.\"\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 6:1-10\nAt that time\, Jesus was going through the grainfields on the sabbath\, and his disciples plucked and ate some heads of grain\, rubbing them in their hands. But some of the Pharisees said\, \"Why are you doing what is not lawful to do on the sabbath?\" And Jesus answered\, \"Have you not read what David did when he was hungry\, he and those who were with him: how he entered the house of God\, and took and ate the bread of the Presence\, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat\, and also gave it to those with him?\" And he said to them\, \"The Son of man is lord of the sabbath.\" On another sabbath\, when he entered the synagogue and taught\, a man was there whose right hand was withered. And the scribes and the Pharisees watched him\, to see whether he would heal on the sabbath\, so that they might find an accusation against him. But he knew their thoughts\, and he said to the man who had the withered hand\, \"Come and stand here.\" And he rose and stood there. And Jesus said to them\, \"I ask you\, is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do harm\, to save life or to destroy it?\" And he looked around on them all\, and said to him\, \"Stretch out your hand.\" And he did so\, and his hand was restored.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 10/13/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Sunday of the 7th Ecumenical Council; Carpus\, Papylus\, Agathodorus\, & Agathonica\, the Martyrs of Pergamus; Benjamin the Deacon; Chryssi the New Martyr of Greece; Meletios of Pegas\, Patriarch of Alexandria; Florentios the Martyr of Thessaloniki; Hieromartyr Jacob of Hamatoura\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Luke 24:12-35\nAt that time\, [Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in\, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home wondering at what had happened. That very day] two of them were going to a village named Emmaus\, about seven miles from Jerusalem\, and talking with each other about all these things that had happened. While they were talking and discussing together\, Jesus Himself drew near and went with them. But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him. And He said to them\, \"What is this conversation which you are holding with each other as you walk?\" and they stood still\, looking sad. Then one of them\, named Cleopas\, answered Him\, \"Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?\" And He said to them\, \"What things?\" And they said to him\, \"Concerning Jesus of Nazareth\, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people\, and how our chief priests and rulers delivered Him up to be condemned to death\, and crucified Him. But we had hoped that He was the one to redeem Israel. Yes\, and besides all this\, it is now the third day since this happened. Moreover\, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning and did not find His body; and they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels\, who said that He was alive. Some of those who were with us went to the tomb\, and found it just as the women had said; but Him they did not see.\" And He said to them\, \"O foolish men\, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Was not it necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into this glory?\" And beginning with Moses and all the prophets\, He interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning Himself. So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He appeared to be going further\, but they constrained Him\, saying\, \"Stay with us\, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.\" So He went in to stay with them. When He was at table with them\, He took the bread and blessed\, and broke it\, and gave it to them. And their eyes were opened and they recognized Him; and He vanished out of their sight. They said to each other\, \"Did not our hearts burn within us while He talked to us on the road\, while He opened to us the scriptures?\" And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven gathered together and those who were with them\, who said\, \"The Lord has risen indeed\, and has appeared to Simon!\" Then they told what had happened on the road and how He was known to them in the breaking of the bread.\n\nEpistle Reading: Titus 3:8-15\nTitus\, my son\, the saying is sure.  I desire you to insist on these things\, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to apply themselves to good deeds; these are excellent and profitable to men.  But avoid stupid controversies\, genealogies\, dissensions\, and quarrels over the law\, for they are unprofitable and futile.  As for a man who is factious\, after admonishing him once or twice\, have nothing more to do with him\, knowing that such a person is perverted and sinful; he is self-condemned.\n\nWhen I send Artemas or Tychicos to you\, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis\, for I have decided to spend the winter there.  Do your best to speed Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way; see that they lack nothing.  And let our people learn to apply themselves to good deeds\, so as to help cases of urgent need\, and not to be unfruitful.\n\nAll who are with me send greeting to you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 8:5-15\nThe Lord said this parable: \"A sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed\, some fell along the path\, and was trodden under foot\, and the birds of the air devoured it. And some fell on the rock; and as it grew up\, it withered away\, because it had no moisture. And some fell among thorns; and the thorns grew with it and choked it. And some fell into good soil and grew\, and yielded a hundredfold.\" And when his disciples asked him what this parable meant\, he said\, \"To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God; but for others they are in parables\, so that seeing they may not see\, and hearing they may not understand. Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. The ones along the path are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts\, that they may not believe and be saved. And the ones on the rock are those who\, when they hear the word\, receive it with joy; but these have no root\, they believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away. And as for what fell among the thorns\, they are those who hear\, but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life\, and their fruit does not mature. And as for that in the good soil\, they are those who\, hearing the word\, hold it fast in an honest and good heart\, and bring forth fruit with patience.\" As he said these things\, he cried out \"He who has ears to hear\, let him hear.\"\n\n

And you he made alive\, when you were dead through the trespasses and sins in which you once walked\, following the course of this world\, following the prince of the power of the air\, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience.

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 10/15/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Lucian the Martyr of Antioch; Savinos the Bishop of Catania; Barsus the Confessor; Euthymios the New\n\nEpistle Reading: Ephesians 2:19-22;3:1-7\nBrethren\, you are no longer strangers and sojourners\, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God\, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets\, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone\, in whom the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord in whom you also are built into it for a dwelling place of God in the Spirit. For this reason I\, Paul\, a prisoner for Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles -- assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace that was given to me for you\, how the mystery was made known to me by revelation\, as I have written briefly. When you read this you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ\, which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; that is\, how the Gentiles are fellow heirs\, members of the same body\, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel. Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God's grace which was given me by the working of his power.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 9:23-27\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"If any man would come after me\, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake\, he will save it. For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself? For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words\, of him will the Son of man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. But I tell you truly\, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Longinus the Centurion
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 10/16/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Longinus the Centurion; The Two Soldiers martyred with Saint Longinus\n\nStrict Fast\n\nEpistle Reading: Ephesians 3:8-21\nBrethren\, to me\, though I am the very least of all the saints\, this grace was given\, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ\, and to make all men see what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things; that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the principalities and powers in the heavenly places. This was according to the eternal purpose which he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord\, in whom we have boldness and confidence of access through our faith in him. So l ask you not to lose heart over what I am suffering for you\, which is your glory. For this reason I bow my knees before the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ\, from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named\, that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with might through his Spirit in the inner man\, and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith\, that you\, being rooted and grounded in love\, may have power to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth\, and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge\, that you may be filled with the fulness of God. Now to him who by the power at work within us is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think\, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations\, for ever and ever. Amen.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 27:33-54\nAt that time\, when the soldiers came to a place called Golgotha (which means the place of a skull)\, they offered him wine to drink\, mingled with gall; but when he tasted it\, he would not drink it. And when they had crucified him\, they divided his garments among them by casting lots; then they sat down and kept watch over him there. And over his head they put the charge against him\, which read\, \"This is Jesus the King of the Jews.\" Then two robbers were crucified with him\, one on the right and one on the left. And those who passed by derided him\, wagging their heads and saying\, \"You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days\, save yourself! If you are the Son of God\, come down from the cross.\" So also the chief priests\, with the scribes and elders\, mocked him\, saying\, \"He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross\, and we will believe in him. He trusts in God; let God deliver him now\, if he desires him; for he said\, 'I am the Son of God.'\" And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way. \n\n Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice\, \"Eli\, Eli\, lama sabachthani?\" that is\, \"My God\, my God\, why have you forsaken me?\" And some of the bystanders hearing it said\, \"This man is calling Elijah.\" And one of them at once ran and took a sponge\, filled it with vinegar\, and put it on a reed\, and gave it to him to drink. But the others said\, \"Wait\, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.\" And Jesus cried again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit. \n\n And behold\, the curtain of the temple was torn in two\, from top to bottom; and the earth shook\, and the rocks were split; the tombs also were opened\, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised\, and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many. When the centurion and those who were with him\, keeping watch over Jesus\, saw the earthquake and what took place\, they were filled with awe\, and said\, \"Truly this was the Son of God!\"\n\n

You will say to me then\, \"Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?\" But who are you\, a man\, to answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its molder\, \"Why have you made me thus?\" Has the potter no right over the clay\, to make out of the same lump one vessel for beauty and another for menial use? What if God\, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power\, has endured with much patience the vessels of wrath made for destruction\, in order to make known the riches of his glory for the vessels of mercy\, which he has prepared beforehand for glory\, even us whom he has called\, not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles? As indeed he says in Hosea\, \"Those who were not my people I will call 'my people\,' and her who was not beloved I will call 'my beloved.'\" \"And in the very place where it was said to them\, 'You are not my people\,' they will be called 'sons of the living God.'\" And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: \"Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea\, only a remnant of them will be saved; for the Lord will execute his sentence upon the earth with rigor and dispatch.\" And as Isaiah predicted\, \"if the Lord of hosts had not left us children\, we would have fared like Sodom and been made like Gomorrah.\" What shall we say\, then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it\, that is\, righteousness through faith; but that Israel who pursued the righteousness which is based on law did not succeed in fulfilling that law. Why? Because they did not pursue it through faith\, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone\, as it is written\, \"Behold\, I am laying in Zion a stone that will make men stumble\, a rock that will make them fall; and he who believes in him will not be put to shame.\"\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 9:49-56\nAt that time\, one of Jesus' disciples came to him and said\, \"Master\, we saw a man casting out demons in your name\, and we forbade him\, because he does not follow with us.\" But Jesus said to him\, \"Do not forbid him; for he that is not against you is for you.\" When the days drew near for him to be received up\, he set his face to go to Jerusalem. And he sent messengers ahead of him\, who went and entered a village of the Samaritans\, to make ready for him; but the people would not receive him\, because his face was set toward Jerusalem. And when his disciples James and John saw it\, they said\, \"Lord\, do you want us to bid fire come down from heaven and consume them as Elijah did?\" But he turned and rebuked them. And they went on to another village.\n\n

Let your speech always be gracious\, seasoned with salt\, so that you may know how you ought to answer every one. Tychicos will tell you all about my affairs; he is a beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord. I have sent him to you for this very purpose\, that you may know how we are and that he may encourage your hearts\, and with him Onesimos\, the faithful and beloved brother\, who is one of yourselves. They will tell you of everything that has taken place. Aristarchos my fellow prisoner greets you\, and Mark the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you have received instructions if he comes to you\, receive him)\, and Jesus who is called Justos. These are the only men of the circumcision among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God\, and they have been a comfort to me. Luke the beloved physician and Demas greet you. Give my greetings to the brethren at Laodicea\, and to Nympha and the church in her house. And when this letter has been read among you\, have it read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and see that you read also the letter from Laodicea. And say to Archippos\, \"See that you fulfill the ministry which you have received in the Lord.\" I\, Paul\, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my fetters. Grace be with you. Amen.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 10:16-21\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"He who hears you hears me\, and he who rejects you rejects me\, and he who rejects me rejects him who sent me.\" The seventy returned with joy\, saying\, \"Lord\, even the demons are subject to us in your name!\" And he said to them\, \"I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. Behold\, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions\, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall hurt you. Nevertheless do not rejoice in this\, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.\" In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said\, \"I thank you\, Father\, Lord of heaven and earth\, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes; yes\, Father\, for such was your gracious will.\"\n\n

For these men are not drunk\, as you suppose\, since it is only the third hour of the day; but this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel: 'And in the last days it shall be\, God declares\, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh\, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy\, and your young men shall see visions\, and your old men shall dream dreams; yea\, and on my menservants and my maid servants in those days I will pour out my Spirit; and they shall prophesy. And I will show wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth beneath\, blood\, and fire\, and vapor of smoke; the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood\, before the day of the Lord comes\, the great and manifest day. And it shall be that whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.'\"\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 7:1-10\nAt that time\, Jesus entered Capernaum. Now a centurion had a slave who was dear to him\, who was sick and at the point of death. When he heard of Jesus\, he sent to him elders of the Jews\, asking him to come and heal his slave. And when they came to Jesus\, they besought him earnestly\, saying\, \"He is worthy to have you do this for him\, for he loves our nation\, and he built us our synagogue.\" And Jesus went with them. When he was not far from the house\, the centurion sent friends to him\, saying to him\, \"Lord\, do not trouble yourself\, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof; therefore I did not presume to come to you. But say the word\, and let my servant be healed. For I am a man set under authority\, with soldiers under me: and I say to one\, 'Go\,' and he goes; and to another\, 'Come\,' and he comes; and to my slave\, 'Do this\,' and he does it.\" When Jesus heard this he marveled at him\, and turned and said to the multitude that followed him\, \"I tell you\, not even in Israel have I found such faith.\" And when those who had been sent returned to the house\, they found the slave well.\n\n

And He said to them\, \"Why are you troubled\, and why do questionings rise in your hearts? See My hands and My feet\, that it is I Myself; handle Me\, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that I have.\" And when He had said this\, He showed them His hands and His feet. And while they still disbelieved for joy\, and wondered\, He said to them\, \"Have you anything here to eat?\" They gave Him a piece of broiled fish [and some honeycomb]\, and He took it and ate before them. Then He said to them\, \"These are My words which I spoke to you\, while I was still with you\, that everything written about Me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled.\" Then He opened their minds to understand the scriptures\, and said to them\, \"Thus it is written\, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead\, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in His name in all nations\, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. And behold\, I send the promise of My Father upon you; but stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.\" Then He led them out as far as Bethany\, and lifting up His hands\, He blessed them. While He blessed them\, He parted from them\, and was carried up into heaven. And they worshiped Him\, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy\, and were continually in the Temple blessing God.\n\nEpistle Reading: II Corinthians 6:16-18;7:1\nBrethren\, you are the temple of the living God; as God said\, \"I will live in them and move among them\, and I will be their God\, and they shall be my people. Therefore come out from them\, and be separate from them\, says the Lord\, and touch nothing unclean; then I will welcome you\, and I will be a father to you\, and you shall be my sons and daughters\, says the Lord Almighty.\"\n\nSince we have these promises\, beloved\, let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit\, and make holiness perfect in the fear of God.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 8:26-39\nAt that time\, as Jesus arrived at the country of the Gadarenes\, there met him a man from the city who had demons; for a long time he had worn no clothes and he lived not in a house but among the tombs. When he saw Jesus\, he cried out and fell down before him\, and said with a loud voice\, \"What have you to do with me\, Jesus\, Son of the Most High God? I beseech you\, do not torment me.\" For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For many a time it had seized him; he was kept under guard\, and bound with chains and fetters\, but he broke the bonds and was driven by the demon into the desert.) Jesus then asked him\, \"What is your name?\" And he said\, \"Legion\"; for many demons had entered him. And they begged him not to command them to depart into the abyss. Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside; and they begged him to let them enter these. So he gave them leave. Then the demons came out of the man and entered the swine\, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned. When the herdsmen saw what happened\, they fled\, and told it in the city and in the country. Then people went out to see what had happened\, and they came to Jesus\, and found the man from whom the demons had gone\, sitting at the feet of Jesus\, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. And those who had seen it told them how he who had been possessed with demons was healed. Then all the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them; for they were seized with great fear; so he got into the boat and returned. The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him; but he sent him away\, saying\, \"Return to your home\, and declare how much God has done for you.\" And he went away\, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.\n\n

Each one must do as he has made up his mind\, not reluctantly or under compulsion\, for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to provide you with every blessing in abundance\, so that you may always have enough of everything and may provide in abundance for every good work.

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 10/22/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Averkios\, Equal-to-the-Apostles and Wonderworker\, Bishop of Hierapolis; Seven Holy Martyred Youths of Ephesus\n\nEpistle Reading: Ephesians 5:20-25\nBrethren\, always and for everything give thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father. Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ. Wives\, be subject to your husbands\, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church\, his body\, and is himself its Savior. As the church is subject to Christ\, so let wives also be subject in everything to their husbands. Husbands\, love your wives\, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 11:1-10\nAt that time\, Jesus was praying in a certain place\, and when he ceased\, one of his disciples said to him\, \"Lord\, teach us to pray\, as John taught his disciples.\" And he said to them\, \"When you pray\, say: 'Our Father which art in heaven\, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done\, as in heaven\, so in earth. Give us each day our daily bread; and forgive us our sins\, for we ourselves forgive every one who is indebted to us; and lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.'\" And he said to them\, \"Which of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight and say to him\, 'Friend\, lend me three loaves; for a friend of mine has arrived on a journey\, and I have nothing to set before him'; and he will answer from within\, 'Do not bother me; the door is now shut\, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything'? I tell you\, though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend\, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him whatever he needs. And I tell you\, Ask\, and it will be given you; seek\, and you will find; knock\, and it will be opened to you. For every one who asks receives\, and he who seeks finds\, and to him who knocks it will be opened.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:James (Iakovos) the Apostle\, brother of Our Lord
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 10/23/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: James (Iakovos) the Apostle\, brother of Our Lord; Our Righteous Father Ignatius\, Patriarch of Constantinople\n\nFast Day (Wine and Oil Allowed)\n\nEpistle Reading: Galatians 1:11-19\nBrethren\, I would have you know that the gospel which was preached by me is not man's gospel. For I did not receive it from man\, nor was I taught it\, but it came through a revelation of Jesus Christ. For you have heard of my former life in Judaism\, how I persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it; and I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people\, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers. But when he who had set me apart before I was born\, and had called me through his grace\, was pleased to reveal his Son to me\, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles\, I did not confer with flesh and blood\, nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me\, but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned to Damascus. Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas\, and remained with him fifteen days. But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord's brother.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 13:54-58\nAt that time\, Jesus came to his own country\, and taught the people in their synagogue so that they were astonished\, and said\, \"Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works? Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all this?\" And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them\, \"A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.\" And he did not do many mighty works there\, because of their unbelief.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 10/24/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Arethas the Great Martyr and His Fellow Martyrs; Sebastiane the Martyr; Maglorious of Sark\n\nEpistle Reading: Ephesians 5:33;6:1-9\nBrethren\, let each one of you love his wife as himself\, and let the wife see that she respects her husband. Children\, obey your parents in the Lord\, for this is right. \"Honor your father and mother\" (this is the first commandment with a promise)\, \"that it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth.\" Fathers\, do not provoke your children to anger\, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. Slaves\, be obedient to those who are your earthly masters\, with fear and trembling\, in singleness of heart\, as to Christ; not in the way of eye-service\, as men-pleasers\, but as servants of Christ\, doing the will of God from the heart\, rendering service with a good will as to the Lord and not to men\, knowing that whatever good any one does\, he will receive the same again from the Lord\, whether he is a slave or free. Masters\, do the same to them\, and forbear threatening\, knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven\, and that there is no partiality with him.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 11:14-23\nAt that time\, Jesus was casting out a demon that was dumb; when the demon had gone out\, the dumb man spoke\, and the people marveled. But some of them said\, \"He casts out demons by Beelzebul\, the prince of demons\"; while others\, to test him\, sought from him a sign from heaven. But he\, knowing their thoughts\, said to them\, \"Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste\, and a divided household falls. And if Satan also is divided against himself\, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul. And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul\, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges. But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons\, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. When a strong man\, fully armed\, guards his own palace\, his goods are in peace; but when one stronger than he assails him and overcomes him\, he takes away his armor in which he trusted\, and divides his spoil. He who is not with me is against me\, and he who does not gather with me scatters.\"\n\n

To that end keep alert with all perseverance\, making supplication for all the saints\, and also for me\, that utterance may be given me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel\, for which I am an ambassador in chains; that I may declare it boldly\, as I ought to speak.\n\nNow that you also may know how I am and what I am doing\, Tychicos the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord will tell you everything.

This will be a time for you to bear testimony. Settle it therefore in your minds\, not to meditate beforehand how to answer; for I will give you a mouth and wisdom\, which none of your adversaries will be able to withstand or contradict. You will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and kinsmen and friends\, and some of you they will put to death; you will be hated by all for my name's sake. But not a hair of your head will perish. By your endurance you will gain your lives.\"\n\nEpistle Reading: II Timothy 2:1-10\nTimothy\, my son\, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus\, and what you have heard from me before many witnesses entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also. Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. No soldier on service gets entangled in civilian pursuits\, since his aim is to satisfy the one who enlisted him. An athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. It is the hardworking farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops. Think over what I say\, for the Lord will grant you understanding in everything.\n\nRemember Jesus Christ\, risen from the dead\, descended from David\, as preached in my gospel\, the gospel for which I am suffering and wearing fetters like a criminal. But the word of God is not fettered. Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect\, that they also may obtain salvation in Christ Jesus with its eternal glory.\n\nGospel Reading: John 15:17-27; 16:1-2\nThe Lord said to his disciples: \"This I command you\, to love one another.  If the world hates you\, know that it has hated me before it hated you.  If you were of the world\, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world\, but I chose you out of the world\, therefore the world hates you.  Remember the word that I said to you\, 'A servant is not greater than his master.'  If they persecuted me\, they will persecute you; if they kept my word\, they will keep yours also.  But all this they will do to you on my account\, because they do not know him who sent me.  If I had not come and spoken to them\, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.  He who hates me hates my Father also.  If I had not done among them the works which no one else did\, they would not have sin; but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father.  It is to fulfill the word that is written in their law\, 'They hated me without a cause.'\n\n  But when the Counselor comes\, whom I shall send to you from the Father\, even the Spirit of truth\, who proceeds from the Father\, he will bear witness to me; and you also are witnesses\, because you have been with me from the beginning.  I have said all this to you to keep you from falling away.  They will put you out of the synagogues; indeed\, the hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God.\"\n\n

So she ran\, and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple\, the one whom Jesus loved\, and said to them\, \"They have taken the Lord out of the tomb\, and we do not know where they have laid Him.\" Peter then came out with the other disciple\, and they went toward the tomb. They both ran\, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first; and stooping to look in\, he saw the linen cloths lying there\, but he did not go in. Then Simon Peter came\, following him\, and went into the tomb; he saw the linen cloths lying and the napkin\, which had been on His head\, not lying with the linen cloths\, but rolled up in a place by itself. Then the other disciple\, who reached the tomb first\, also went in\, and he saw and believed; for as yet they did not know the scripture\, that He must rise from the dead. Then the disciples went back to their homes.\n\nEpistle Reading: II Corinthians 9:6-11\nBrethren\, he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly\, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.

You will be enriched in every way for great generosity\, which through us will produce thanksgiving to God.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 8:41-56\nAt that time\, there came to Jesus a man named Jairus\, who was a ruler of the synagogue; and falling at Jesus' feet he besought him to come to his house\, for he had an only daughter\, about twelve years of age\, and she was dying. As he went\, the people pressed round him. And a woman who had had a flow of blood for twelve years and had spent all her living upon physicians and could not be healed by anyone\, came up behind him\, and touched the fringe of his garment; and immediately her flow of blood ceased. And Jesus said\, \"Who was it that touched me?\" When all denied it\, Peter and those who were with him said\, \"Master\, the multitudes surround you and press upon you!\" But Jesus said\, \"Some one touched me; for I perceive that power has gone forth from me.\" And when the woman saw that she was not hidden\, she came trembling\, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him\, and how she had been immediately healed. And he said to her\, \"Daughter\, your faith has made you well; go in peace.\" While he was still speaking\, a man from the ruler's house came and said\, \"Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the Teacher any more.\" But Jesus on hearing this answered him\, \"Do not fear; only believe\, and she shall be well.\" And when he came to the house\, he permitted no one to enter with him\, except Peter and John and James\, and the father and mother of the child. And all were weeping and bewailing her; but he said\, \"Do not weep; for she is not dead but sleeping.\" And they laughed at him\, knowing that she was dead. But taking her by the hand he called\, saying\, \"Child\, arise.\" And her spirit returned\, and she got up at once; and he directed that something should be given her to eat. And her parents were amazed; but he charged them to tell no one what had happened.\n\n

And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary\, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and she exclaimed with a loud cry\, \"Blessed are you among women\, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why is this granted me\, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold\, when the voice of your greeting came to my ears\, the babe in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.\"\n\n  And Mary said\, \"My soul magnifies the Lord\, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior\, for he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden. For behold\, henceforth all generations will call me blessed; for he who is mighty has done great things for me\, and holy is his name.\" And Mary remained with her about three months\, and returned to her home.\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 9:1-7\nBRETHREN\, the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary. For a tent was prepared\, the outer one\, in which were the lampstand and the table and the bread of the Presence; it is called the Holy Place. Behind the second curtain stood a tent called the Holy of Holies\, having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold\, which contained a golden urn holding the manna\, and Aaron's rod that budded\, and the tables of the covenant; above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail. These preparations having thus been made\, the priests go continually into the outer tent\, performing their ritual duties; but into the second only the high priest goes\, and he but once a year\, and not without taking blood which he offers for himself and for the errors of the people.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 10:38-42\, 11:27-28\nAt that time\, Jesus entered a village; and a woman called Martha received him into her house. And she had a sister called Mary\, who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his teaching. But Martha was distracted with much serving; and she went to him and said\, \"Lord\, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve you alone? Tell her then to help me.\" But the Lord answered her\, \"Martha\, Martha\, you are anxious and troubled about many things; one thing is needful. Mary has chosen the good portion\, which shall not be taken away from her.\" As he said this\, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him\, \"Blessed is the womb that bore you\, and the breasts that you sucked!\" But he said\, \"Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it!\"\n\n

And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more\, with knowledge and all discernment\, so that you may approve what is excellent\, and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ\, filled with the fruits of righteousness which come through Jesus Christ\, to the glory and praise of God. I want you to know\, brethren\, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel\, so that it has become known throughout the whole praetorian guard and to all the rest that my imprisonment is for Christ; and most of the brethren have been made confident in the Lord because of my imprisonment\, and are much more bold to speak the word of God without fear.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 11:34-41\nThe Lord said\, \"Your eye is the lamp of your body; when your eye is sound\, your whole body is full of light; but when it is not sound\, your body is full of darkness. Therefore be careful lest the light in you be darkness. If then your whole body is full of light\, having no part dark\, it will be wholly bright\, as when a lamp with its rays gives you light.\" While he was speaking\, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him; so he went in and sat at table. The Pharisee was astonished to see that he did not first wash before dinner. And the Lord said to him\, \"Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish\, but inside you are full of extortion and wickedness. You fools! Did not he who made the outside make the inside also? But give for alms those things which are within and behold\, everything is clean for you.\"\n\n

Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry\, but others from good will.  The latter do it out of love\, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel; the former proclaim Christ out of partisanship\, not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment.

And God has appointed in the church first apostles\, second prophets\, third teachers\, then workers of miracles\, then healers\, helpers\, administrators\, speakers in various kinds of tongues.  Are all apostles?  Are all prophets?  Are all teachers?  Do all work miracles?  Do all possess gifts of healing?  Do all speak with tongues?  Do all interpret?  But earnestly desire the higher gifts.  And I will show you a still more excellent way.  If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels\, but have not love\, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.  And if I have prophetic powers\, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge\, and if I have all faith\, so as to remove mountains\, but have not love\, I am nothing.  If I give away all I have\, and if I deliver my body to be burned\, but have not love\, I gain nothing. Love is patient and kind; love is not jealous or boastful; it is not arrogant or rude. Love does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrong\, but rejoices in the right. Love bears all things\, believes all things\, hopes all things\, endures all things. Love never ends.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 10:1\, 5-8\nAt that time\, Jesus called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits\, to cast them out\, and to heal every disease and every infirmity.  These twelve Jesus sent out\, charging them\, \"Go nowhere among the Gentiles\, and enter no town of the Samaritans\, but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.  And preach as you go\, saying\, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.'  Heal the sick\, raise the dead\, cleanse lepers\, cast out demons.  You received without paying\, give without pay.\"\n\n

Now concerning the contribution for the saints: as I directed the churches of Galatia\, so you also are to do. On the first day of every week\, each of you is to put something aside and store it up\, as he may prosper\, so that contributions need not be made when I come. And when I arrive\, I will send those whom you accredit by letter to carry your gift to Jerusalem.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 9:1-6\nAt that time\, Jesus called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases\, and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal. And he said to them\, \"Take nothing for your journey\, no staff\, nor bag\, nor bread\, nor money; and do not have two tunics. And whatever house you enter\, stay there\, and from there depart. And wherever they do not receive you\, when you leave that town shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them.\" And they departed and went through the villages\, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.\n\n

SUMMARY:5th Sunday of Luke
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 11/03/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: 5th Sunday of Luke; Acepsimas the Bishop\, Joseph the Presbyter\, & Aeithalas the Deacon\, Martyrs of Persia; Dedication of the Temple of the Holy Great Martyr George in Lydda; George of Neapolis the New Martyr; Holy Father and New Hieromartyr Gregory of Neapolis; Theodore the Confessor\, Bishop of Ancyra; Winifred of Treffynnon\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: John 20:11-18\nAt that time\, Mary stood weeping outside the tomb\, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb\, and she saw two angels in white\, sitting where the body of Jesus has lain\, one at the head and one at the feet. They said to her\, \"Woman\, why are you weeping?\" She said to them\, \"Because they have taken away my Lord\, and I do not know where they have laid Him.\" Saying this\, she turned round and saw Jesus standing\, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her\, \"Woman\, why are you weeping? Whom do you seek?\" Supposing Him to be the gardener\, she said to Him\, \"Sir\, if you have carried Him away\, tell me where you have laid Him\, and I will take Him away.\" Jesus said to her\, \"Mary.\" She turned and said to Him in Hebrew\, \"Rabboni\,\" which means Teacher. Jesus said to her\, \"Do not touch Me\, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brethren and say to them\, I am ascending to My Father and your Father\, to My God and your God.\" Mary Magdalene went and said to the disciples\, \"I have seen the Lord\,\" and she told them that He had said these things to her.\n\nEpistle Reading: II Corinthians 11:31-33;12:1-9\nBrethren\, the God and Father of the Lord Jesus\, he who is blessed for ever\, knows that I do not lie. At Damascus\, the governor under King Aretas guarded the city of Damascus in order to seize me\, but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall\, and escaped his hands.\n\nI must boast; there is nothing to be gained by it\, but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven -- whether in the body or out of the body I do not know\, God knows. And I know that this man was caught up into Paradise --whether in the body or out of the body I do not know\, God knows -- and he heard things that cannot be told\, which man may not utter. On behalf of this man I will boast\, but on my own behalf I will not boast\, except of my weaknesses. Though if I wish to boast\, I shall not be a fool\, for I shall be speaking the truth. But I refrain from it\, so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me. And to keep me from being too elated by the abundance of revelations\, a thorn was given me in the flesh\, a messenger of Satan\, to harass me\, to keep me from being too elated. Three times I besought the Lord about this\, that it should leave me; but he said to me\, \"My grace is sufficient for you\, for my power is made perfect in weakness.\" I will all the more gladly boast of my weaknesses\, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 16:19-31\nThe Lord said\, \"There was a rich man\, who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. And at his gate lay a poor man named Lazaros\, full of sores\, who desired to be fed with what fell from the rich man's table; moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died and was buried; and in Hades\, being in torment\, he lifted up his eyes\, and saw Abraham far off and Lazaros in his bosom. And he called out\, 'Father Abraham\, have mercy upon me\, and send Lazaros to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame.' But Abraham said\, 'Son\, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things\, and Lazaros in like manner evil things; but now he is comforted here\, and you are in anguish. And besides all this\, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed\, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able\, and none may cross from there to us.' And he said\, 'Then I beg you\, father\, to send him to my father's house\, for I have five brothers\, so that he may warn them\, lest they also come into this place of torment.' But Abraham said\, 'They have Moses\, and the prophets; let them hear them.' And he said\, 'No\, father Abraham; but if some one goes to them from the dead\, they will repent.' He said to them\, 'If they do not hear Moses and the prophets\, neither will they be convinced if some one should rise from the dead.'\"\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 11/04/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Joannicius the Great; The Holy Hieromartyrs Nicander\, Bishop of Myra\, and Hermias the Presbyter; Porphyrios the Mime; Emperor John Batatze the Merciful; George Karslidis of Pontos\n\nEpistle Reading: Philippians 2:12-15\nBrethren\, as you have always obeyed\, so now\, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence\, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for God is at work in you\, both to will and to work for his good pleasure. Do all things without grumbling or questioning\, that you may be blameless and innocent\, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation\, among whom you shine as lights in the world\, holding fast the word of life\, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 12:13-15\, 22-31\nAt that time\, while Jesus was teaching\, one of the multitude said to him\, \"Teacher\, bid my brother divide the inheritance with me.\" But he said to him\, \"Man\, who made me a judge or divider over you?\" And he said to them\, \"Take heed\, and beware of all covetousness; for a man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions. Therefore I tell you\, do not be anxious about your life\, what you shall eat\, nor about your body\, what you shall put on. For life is more than food\, and the body more than clothing. Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap\, they have neither storehouse nor barn\, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more value are you than the birds! And which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his span of life? If then you are not able to do as small a thing as that\, why are you anxious about the rest? Consider the lilies\, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you\, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass which is alive in the field today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven\, how much more will he clothe you\, O men of little faith! And do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink\, nor be of anxious mind. For all the nations of the world seek these things; and your Father knows that you need them. Instead\, seek his kingdom\, and these things shall be yours as well.\"\n\n

Even if I am to be poured as a libation upon the sacrifical offering of your faith\, I am glad and rejoice with you all. Likewise you also should be glad and rejoice with me. I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon\, so that I may be cheered by news of you. I have no one like him\, who will be genuinely anxious for your welfare. They all look after their own interests\, not those of Jesus Christ. But Timothy's worth you know\, how as a son with a father he has served with me in the gospel. I hope therefore to send him just as soon as I see how it will go with me.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 12:42-48\nThe Lord said\, \"Who then is the faithful and wise steward\, whom his master will set over his household\, to give them their portion of food at the proper time? Blessed is that servant whom his master when he comes will find so doing. Truly\, I say to you\, he will set him over all his possessions. But if that servant says to himself\, 'My master is delayed in coming\,' and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants\, and to eat and drink and get drunk\, the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know\, and will punish him\, and put him with the unfaithful. And that servant who knew his master's will\, but did not make ready or act according to his will\, shall receive a severe beating. But he who did not know\, and did what deserved a beating\, shall receive a light beating. Every one to whom much is given\, of him will much be required; and of him to whom men commit much they will demand the more.\"\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 11/06/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Paul the Confessor\, Patriarch of Constantinople; Luke the Monk of Taormina\n\nStrict Fast\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 8:1-6\nBrethren\, we have such a high priest\, one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven\, a minister in the sanctuary and the true tent which is set up not by man but by the Lord. For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; hence it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer. Now if he were on earth\, he would not be a priest at all\, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law. They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary; for when Moses was about to erect the tent\, he was instructed by God\, saying\, \"See that you make everything according to the pattern which was shown you on the mountain.\" But as it is\, he has obtained a ministry which is as much more excellent than the old as the covenant he mediates is better\, since it is enacted on better promises.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 12:8-12\nThe Lord said to His disciples\, \"Every one who acknowledges me before men\, the Son of Man also will acknowledge before the angels of God; but he who denies me before men will be denied before the angels of God.  And every one who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.  And when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities\, do not be anxious how or what you are to answer or what you are to say; for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say.\"\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 11/07/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: 33 Martyrs of Melitene; Lazarus the Wonderworker; Martyr Athenodorus; Alexander the Martyr of Thessaloniki\n\nEpistle Reading: Philippians 3:1-8\nBrethren\, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you is not irksome to me\, and is safe for you. Look out for the dogs\, look out for the evil-workers\, look out for those who mutilate the flesh. For we are the true circumcision\, who worship God in spirit\, and glory in Christ Jesus\, and put no confidence in the flesh. Though  I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also. If any other man  thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh\, I have more: circumcised on the eighth day\, of the people of Israel\, of the tribe of Benjamin\, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to the law a Pharisee\, as to zeal a persecutor of the church\, as to righteousness under the law blameless. But whatever gain I had\, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. Indeed I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things\, and count them as refuse\, in order that I may gain Christ.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 13:1-9\nAt that time\, there were some present who told Jesus of the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. And he answered them\, \"Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans\, because they suffered thus? I tell you\, No; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish. Or those eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them\, do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who dwelt in Jerusalem? I tell you\, No; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.\" And he told this parable: \"A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came seeking fruit on it and found none. And he said to the vinedresser\, 'Lo\, these three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree\, and I find none. Cut it down; why should it use up the ground?' And he answered him\, 'Let it alone\, sir\, this year also\, till I dig about it and put on manure. And if it bears fruit next year\, well and good; but if not\, you can cut it down.'\"\n\n

For the Son of man came to save the lost. What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep\, and one of them has gone astray\, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go in search of the one that went astray? And if he finds it\, truly\, I say to you\, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray. So it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.\n\n\"If your brother sins against you\, go and tell him his fault\, between you and him alone. If he listens to you\, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen\, take one or two others along with you\, that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them\, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church\, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. Truly\, I say to you\, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven\, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Again I say to you\, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask\, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven\, for where two or three are gathered in my name\, there am I in the midst of them.\"\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 2:2-10\nBrethren\, if the message declared by angels was valid and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution\, how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord\, and it was attested to us by those who heard him\, while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his own will. For it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come\, of which we are speaking. It has been testified somewhere\, \"What is man that thou art mindful of him\, or the son of man\, that thou carest for him? Thou didst make him for a little while lower than the angels\, thou hast crowned him with glory and honor\, putting everything in subjection under his feet.\" Now in putting everything in subjection to him\, he left nothing outside his control. As it is\, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him. But we see Jesus\, who for a little while was made lower than the angels\, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death\, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for every one. For it was fitting that he\, for whom and by whom all things exist\, in bringing many sons to glory\, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through suffering.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 10:16-21\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"He who hears you hears me\, and he who rejects you rejects me\, and he who rejects me rejects him who sent me.\" The seventy returned with joy\, saying\, \"Lord\, even the demons are subject to us in your name!\" And he said to them\, \"I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. Behold\, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions\, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall hurt you. Nevertheless do not rejoice in this\, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.\" In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said\, \"I thank you\, Father\, Lord of heaven and earth\, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes; yes\, Father\, for such was your gracious will.\"\n\n

But know this\, that if the householder had known in what part of the night the thief was coming\, he would have watched and would not have let his house be broken into. Therefore you also must be ready; for the Son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect. Who then is the faithful and wise servant whom his master has set over his household\, to give them their food at the proper time? Blessed is that servant whom his master when he comes will find so doing. Truly\, I say to you\, he will set him over all his possessions.\"\n\nEpistle Reading: Ephesians 5:8-19\nBrethren\, walk as children of light (for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true)\, and try to learn what is pleasing to the Lord. Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness\, but instead expose them. For it is a shame even to speak of the things that they do in secret; but when anything is exposed by the light it becomes visible\, for anything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it is said\, \"Awake\, O sleeper\, and arise from the dead\, and Christ shall give you light.\" Look carefully then how you walk\, not as unwise men but as wise\, making the most of the time\, because the days are evil. Therefore do not be foolish\, but understand what the will of the Lord is. And do not get drunk with wine\, for that is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit\, addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs\, singing and making melody to the Lord with all your heart.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 4:25\, 5:1-12\nAt that time\, great crowds followed Jesus from Galilee and the Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and from beyond the Jordan. Seeing the crowds\, he went up on the mountain\, and when he sat down his disciples came to him. And he opened his mouth and taught them\, saying: \"Blessed are the poor in spirit\, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn\, for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek\, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness\, for they shall be satisfied. Blessed are the merciful\, for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart\, for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers\, for they shall be called sons of God. Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake\, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad\, for your reward is great in heaven.\"\n\n

Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again\, \"Peace be with you. As the Father has sent Me\, even so I send you.\" And when He had said this\, He breathed on them and said to them\, \"Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any\, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any\, they are retained.\" Now Thomas\, one of the twelve\, called the Twin\, was not with them when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him\, \"We have seen the Lord.\" But he said to them\, \"Unless I see in His hands the print of the nails\, and place my finger in the mark of the nails\, and place my hand in His side\, I will not believe.\" Eight days later\, His disciples were again in the house\, and Thomas was with them. The doors were shut\, but Jesus came and stood among them and said\, \"Peace be with you.\" Then He said to Thomas\, \"Put your finger here\, and see My hands; and put out your hand\, and place it in My side; do not be faithless\, but believing.\" Thomas answered Him\, \"My Lord and My God!\" Jesus said to him\, \"Have you believed because you have seen Me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe.\" Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples\, which are not written in this book; but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ\, the Son of God\, and that believing\, you may have life in His name.\n\nEpistle Reading: Galatians 1:11-19\nBrethren\, I would have you know that the gospel which was preached by me is not man's gospel. For I did not receive it from man\, nor was I taught it\, but it came through a revelation of Jesus Christ. For you have heard of my former life in Judaism\, how I persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it; and I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people\, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers. But when he who had set me apart before I was born\, and had called me through his grace\, was pleased to reveal his Son to me\, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles\, I did not confer with flesh and blood\, nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me\, but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned to Damascus. Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas\, and remained with him fifteen days. But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord's brother.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 10:25-37\nAt that time\, a lawyer stood up to put Jesus to the test\, saying\, \"Teacher\, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\" He said to him\, \"What is written in the law? How do you read?\" And he answered\, \"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart\, and with all your soul\, and with all your strength\, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.\" And he said to him\, \"You have answered right; do this\, and you will live.\" \n\n But he\, desiring to justify himself\, said to Jesus\, \"And who is my neighbor?\" Jesus replied\, \"A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho\, and he fell among robbers\, who stripped him and beat him\, and departed\, leaving him half dead. Now by chance a priest was going down that road; and when he saw him he passed by on the other side. So likewise a Levite\, when he came to the place and saw him\, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan\, as he journeyed\, came to where he was; and when he saw him\, he had compassion\, and went to him and bound up his wounds\, pouring on oil and wine; then he set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn\, and took care of him. And the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper\, saying\, 'Take care of him; and whatever more you spend\, I will repay you when I come back.' Which of these three\, do you think\, proved neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?\" He said\, \"The one who showed mercy on him.\" And Jesus said to him\, \"Go and do likewise.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Menas of Egypt
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 11/11/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Menas of Egypt; Victor and Stephanie; Martyr Vincent; Theodore the Studite\n\nEpistle Reading: II Corinthians 4:6-15\nBrethren\, it is the God who said\, \"Let light shine out of darkness\,\" who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.\n\nBut we have this treasure in earthen vessels\, to show that the transcendent power belongs to God and not to us.  We are afflicted in every way\, but not crushed; perplexed\, but not driven to despair; persecuted\, but not forsaken; struck down\, but not destroyed; always carrying in the body the death of Jesus\, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies.  For while we live we are always being given up to death for Jesus' sake\, so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.  So death is at work in us\, but life in you.\n\nSince we have the same spirit of faith as he had who wrote\, \"I believed\, and so I spoke\,\" we too believe\, and so we speak\, knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence.  For it is all for your sake\, so that as grace extends to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving\, to the glory of God.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 14:1\, 12-15\nAt that time\, Jesus entered the home of a certain ruler of the Pharisees on the Sabbath to eat bread. And he said to the man who had invited him\, \"When you give a dinner or a banquet\, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your kinsmen or rich neighbors\, lest they also invite you in return\, and you be repaid. But when you give a feast\, invite the poor\, the maimed\, the lame\, the blind\, and you will be blessed\, because they cannot repay you. You will be repaid at the resurrection of the just.\" When one of those who sat at table with him heard this\, he said to him\, \"Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God!\"\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 11/12/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: John the Merciful\, Patriarch of Alexandria; Nilus the Ascetic of Sinai; Leondos Styppi\, Patriarch of Constantinople; Martin\, Bishop of Tours\n\nEpistle Reading: II Corinthians 9:6-11\nBrethren\, he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly\, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. Each one must do as he has made up his mind\, not reluctantly or under compulsion\, for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to provide you with every blessing in abundance\, so that you may always have enough of everything and may provide in abundance for every good work. As it is written\, \"He scatters abroad\, he gives to the poor; his righteousness endures for ever.\" He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your resources and increase the harvest of your righteousness. You will be enriched in every way for great generosity\, which through us will produce thanksgiving to God.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 5:14-19\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"You are the light of the world.  A city set on a hill cannot be hid.  Nor do men light a lamp and put it under a bushel\, but on a stand\, and it gives light to all in the house.  Let your light so shine before men\, that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.  Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfill them.  For truly\, I say to you\, till heaven and earth pass away\, not an iota\, not a dot\, will pass from the law until all is accomplished.  Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so\, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:John Chrysostom\, Archbishop of Constantinople
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 11/13/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: John Chrysostom\, Archbishop of Constantinople; Anthousa\, the Mother of John Chrysostom; Damaskinos the New Martyr of Mount Athos\n\nFast Day (Wine and Oil Allowed)\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: John 10:1-9\nThe Lord said to the Jews who had come to him\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way\, that man is a thief and a robber; but he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the gatekeeper opens; the sheep hear his voice\, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own\, he goes before them\, and the sheep follow him\, for they know his voice. A stranger they will not follow\, but they will flee from him\, for they do not know the voice of strangers.\" This figure Jesus used with them\, but they did not understand what he was saying to them. So Jesus again said to them\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, I am the door of the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not heed them. I am the door; if any one enters by me\, he will be saved\, and will go in and out and find pasture.\"\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 7:26-28;8:1-2\nBrethren\, it was fitting that we should have such a high priest\, holy\, blameless\, unstained\, separated from sinners\, exalted above the heavens.  He has no need\, like those high priests\, to offer sacrifices daily\, first for his own sins and then for those of the people; he did this once for all when he offered up himself.  Indeed\, the law appoints men in their weakness as high priests\, but the word of the oath\, which came later than the law\, appoints a Son who has been made perfect for ever.  Now the point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest\, one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven\, a minister in the sanctuary and the true tent which is set up not by man but by the Lord. \n\nGospel Reading: John 10:9-16\nThe Lord said\, \"I am the door; if any one enters by me\, he will be saved\, and will go in and out and find pasture.  The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came that they may have life\, and have it abundantly.  I am the good shepherd.  The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.  He who is a hireling and not a shepherd\, whose own the sheep are not\, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.  He flees because he is a hireling and cares nothing for the sheep.  I am the good shepherd; I know my own and my own know me\, as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.  And I have other sheep\, that are not of this fold; I must bring them also\, and they will heed my voice. So there shall be one flock\, one shepherd.\"\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 11/14/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Philip the Apostle; Gregory Palamas\, Archbishop of Thessaloniki; Holy Great New Martyr Constantine of Hydra; Justinian the Emperor and his wife Theodora\n\nEpistle Reading: I Corinthians 4:9-16\nBrethren\, God has exhibited us apostles as last of all\, like men sentenced to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world\, to angels and to men. We are fools for Christ's sake\, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak\, but you are strong. You are held in honor\, but we in disrepute. To the present hour we hunger and thirst\, we are ill-clad and buffeted and homeless\, and we labor\, working with our own hands. When reviled\, we bless; when persecuted\, we endure; when slandered\, we try to conciliate; we have become\, and are now\, as the refuse of the world\, the off-scouring of all things. I do not write this to make you ashamed\, but to admonish you as my beloved children. For though you have countless guides in Christ\, you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel. I urge you\, then\, be imitators of me.\n\nGospel Reading: John 1:43-51\nAt that time\, Jesus decided to go to Galilee.  And he found Philip and said to him\, \"Follow me.\"  Now Philip was from Bethsaida\, the city of Andrew and Peter.  Philip found Nathanael\, and he said to him\, \"We have found him of whom Moses in the law and also the prophets wrote\, Jesus of Nazareth\, the son of Joseph.\"  Nathanael said to him\, \"Can anything good come out of Nazareth?\"  Philip said to him\, \"Come and see.\"  Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him\, and said of him\, \"Behold\, an Israelite indeed\, in whom is no guile!\"  Nathanael said to him\, \"How do you know me?\"  Jesus answered him\, \"Before Philip called you\, when you were under the fig tree\, I saw you.\"  Nathanael answered him\, \"Rabbi\, you are the Son of God!  You are the King of Israel!\"  Jesus answered him\, \"Because I said to you\, I saw you under the fig tree\, do you believe?  You shall see greater things than these.\"  And he said to him\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, you will see heaven opened\, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.\"\n\n

I say this in order that no one may delude you with beguiling speech. For though I am absent in body\, yet I am with you in spirit\, rejoicing to see your good order and the firmness of your faith in Christ. As therefore you received Christ Jesus the Lord\, so live in him\, rooted and built up in him and established in the faith\, just as you were taught\, abounding in thanksgiving.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 16:15-18; 17:1-4\nThe Lord said to the Jews who came to him\, \"You are those who justify yourselves before men\, but God knows your hearts; for what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God. The law and the prophets were until John; since then the good news of the kingdom of God is preached\, and every one enters it violently. But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away\, than for one dot of the law to become void. Every one who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery\, and he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.\" \n\n And he said to his disciples\, \"Temptations to sin are sure to come; but woe to him by whom they come! It would be better for him if a millstone were hung round his neck and he were cast into the sea\, than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin. Take heed to yourselves; if your brother sins\, rebuke him\, and if he repents\, forgive him; and if he sins against you seven times in the day\, and turns to you seven times\, and says\, 'I repent\,' you must forgive him.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Matthew the Apostle & Evangelist
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 11/16/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Matthew the Apostle & Evangelist\n\nFast Day (Fish Allowed)\n\nEpistle Reading: Romans 10:11-21;11:1-2\nBrethren\, the scripture says\, \"No one who believes in God will be put to shame.\" For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and bestows his riches upon all who call upon him. For\, \"every one who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.\" But how are men to call upon him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without a preacher? And how can men preach unless they are sent? As it is written\, \"How beautiful are the feet of those who preach good news!\" But they have not all obeyed the gospel; for Isaiah says\, \"Lord\, who has believed what he has heard from us?\" So faith comes from what is heard\, and what is heard comes by the preaching of Christ. But I ask\, have they not heard? Indeed they have; for \"Their voice has gone out to all the earth\, and their words to the ends of the world.\" Again I ask\, did Israel not understand? First Moses says\, \"I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation; with a foolish nation I will make you angry.\" Then Isaiah is so bold as to say\, \"I have been found by those who did not seek me; I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me.\" But of Israel he says\, \"All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.\" I ask\, then\, has God rejected his people? By no means! I myself am an Israelite\, a descendant of Abraham\, a member of the tribe of Benjamin. God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 9:9-13\nAt that time\, as Jesus passed on\, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax office; and he said to him\, \"Follow me.\" And he rose and followed him.\n\nAnd as he sat at table in the house\, behold\, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples. And when the Pharisees saw this\, they said to his disciples\, \"Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?\" But when he heard it\, he said\, \"Those who are well have no need of a physician\, but those who are sick. Go and learn what this means\, 'I desire mercy\, and not sacrifice.' For I came not to call the righteous\, but sinners to repentance.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:9th Sunday of Luke
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 11/17/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: 9th Sunday of Luke; Gregory the Wonderworker & Bishop of Neo-Caesarea; Gennadios I and Maximus\, Patriarchs of Constantinople; Righteous Mother Hilda of Whitby\n\nFast Day (Fish Allowed)\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: John 21:1-14\nAt that time\, Jesus revealed Himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias; and He revealed Himself in this way. Simon Peter\, Thomas\, called the Twin\, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee\, the sons of Zebedee\, and two others of His disciples were together. Simon Peter said to them\, \"I am going fishing.\" They said to him\, \"We will go with you.\" They went out and got into the boat\, but that night they caught nothing. Just as day was breaking\, Jesus stood on the beach\, yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to them\, \"Children\, have you any fish?\" They answered him\, \"No.\" He said to them\, \"Cast the net on the right side of the boat\, and you will find some.\" So they cast it\, and now they were not able to haul it in\, for the quantity of fish. That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter\, \"It is the Lord!\" When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord\, he put on his clothes\, for he was stripped for work\, and sprang into the sea. But the other disciples came in the boat\, dragging the net full of fish\, for they were not far from the land\, but about a hundred yards off. When they got out on land\, they saw a charcoal fire there with fish lying on it\, and bread. Jesus said to them\, \"Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.\" So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore\, full of large fish\, a hundred and fifty-three of them; and although there were so many\, the net was not torn. Jesus said to them\, \"Come and have breakfast.\" Now none of the disciples dared ask Him\, \"Who are you?\" They knew it was the Lord. Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them\, and so with the fish. This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after He was raised from the dead..\n\nEpistle Reading: Galatians 2:16-20\nBrethren\, knowing that a man is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ\, even we have believed in Christ Jesus\, in order to be justified by faith in Christ\, and not by works of the law\, because by works of the law shall no one be justified. But if\, in our endeavor to be justified in Christ\, we ourselves were found to be sinners\, is Christ then an agent of sin? Certainly not! But if I build up again those things which I tore down\, then I prove myself a transgressor. For I through the law died to the law\, that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live\, but Christ who lives in me; and the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God\, who loved me and gave himself for me.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 12:16-21\nThe Lord said this parable: \"The land of a rich man brought forth plentifully; and he thought to himself\, 'What shall I do\, for I have nowhere to store my crops?' And he said\, 'I will do this: I will pull down my barns\, and build larger ones; and there I will store all my grain and my goods. And I will say to my soul\, 'Soul\, you have ample goods laid up for many years; take your ease\, eat\, drink\, be merry.' But God said to him\, 'Fool! This night your soul is required of you; and the things you have prepared\, whose will they be?'  So is he who lays up treasure for himself\, and is not rich toward God.\" As he said these things\, he cried out: \"He who has ears to hear\, let him hear.\"\n\n

He disarmed the principalities and powers and made a public example of them\, triumphing over them in him. Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a sabbath. These are only a shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ. Let no one disqualify you\, insisting on self-abasement and worship of angels\, taking his stand on visions\, puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind\, and not holding fast to the Head\, from whom the whole body\, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments\, grows with a growth that is from God. If with Christ you died to the elemental spirits of the universe\, why do you live as if you still belonged to the world?\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 17:20-25\nAt that time\, when Jesus was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was coming\, he answered them\, \"The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed; nor will they say\, 'Lo\, here it is!' or 'There!' for behold\, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you.\" And he said to the disciples\, \"The days are coming when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of man\, and you will not see it. And they will say to you\, 'Lo\, there!' or 'Lo\, here!' Do not go\, do not follow them. For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other\, so will the Son of man be in his day. But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.\"\n\n

Why do you submit to regulations\, \"Do not handle\, Do not taste\, Do not touch\" (referring to things which all perish as they are used)\, according to human precepts and doctrines? These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting rigor of devotion and self-abasement and severity to the body\, but they are of no value in checking the indulgence of the flesh. If then you have been raised with Christ\, seek the things that are above\, where Christ is\, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things that are above\, not on things that are on earth. For you have died\, and your life is hid with Christ in God.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 17:26-37; 18:8\nThe Lord said\, \"As it was in the days of Noah\, so will it be in the days of the Son of man. They ate\, they drank\, they married\, they were given in marriage\, until the day when Noah entered the ark\, and the flood came and destroyed them all. Likewise as it was in the days of Lot -- they ate\, they drank\, they bought\, they sold\, they planted\, they built\, but on the day when Lot went out from Sodom fire and sulphur rained from heaven and destroyed them all -- so will it be on the day when the Son of man is revealed. On that day\, let him who is on the housetop\, with his goods in the house\, not come down to take them away; and likewise let him who is in the field not turn back. Remember Lot's wife. Whoever seeks to gain his life will lose it\, but whoever loses his life will preserve it. I tell you\, in that night there will be two in one bed; one will be taken and the other left. There will be two women grinding together; one will be taken and the other left.\" And they said to him\, \"Where\, Lord?\" He said to them\, \"Where the body is\, there the eagles will be gathered together. Nevertheless\, when the Son of man comes\, will he find faith on earth?\"\n\n

And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary\, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and she exclaimed with a loud cry\, \"Blessed are you among women\, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why is this granted me\, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold\, when the voice of your greeting came to my ears\, the babe in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.\"\n\n  And Mary said\, \"My soul magnifies the Lord\, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior\, for he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden. For behold\, henceforth all generations will call me blessed; for he who is mighty has done great things for me\, and holy is his name.\" And Mary remained with her about three months\, and returned to her home.\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 9:1-7\nBRETHREN\, the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary. For a tent was prepared\, the outer one\, in which were the lampstand and the table and the bread of the Presence; it is called the Holy Place. Behind the second curtain stood a tent called the Holy of Holies\, having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold\, which contained a golden urn holding the manna\, and Aaron's rod that budded\, and the tables of the covenant; above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail. These preparations having thus been made\, the priests go continually into the outer tent\, performing their ritual duties; but into the second only the high priest goes\, and he but once a year\, and not without taking blood which he offers for himself and for the errors of the people.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 10:38-42\, 11:27-28\nAt that time\, Jesus entered a village; and a woman called Martha received him into her house. And she had a sister called Mary\, who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his teaching. But Martha was distracted with much serving; and she went to him and said\, \"Lord\, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve you alone? Tell her then to help me.\" But the Lord answered her\, \"Martha\, Martha\, you are anxious and troubled about many things; one thing is needful. Mary has chosen the good portion\, which shall not be taken away from her.\" As he said this\, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him\, \"Blessed is the womb that bore you\, and the breasts that you sucked!\" But he said\, \"Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it!\"\n\n

I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers\, because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and all the saints\, and I pray that the sharing of your faith may promote the knowledge of all the good that is ours in Christ. For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love\, my brother\, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you. Accordingly\, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required\, yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you - I\, Paul\, an ambassador and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus - I appeal to you for my child\, Onesimos\, whose father I have become in my imprisonment. (Formerly he was useless to you\, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.) I am sending him back to you\, sending my very heart. I would have been glad to keep him with me\, in order that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel; but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be by compulsion but of your own free will. Perhaps this is why he was parted from you for a while\, that you might have him back for ever\, no longer as a slave but more than a slave\, as a beloved brother\, especially to me but how much more to you\, both in the flesh and in the Lord. So if you consider me your partner\, receive him as you would receive me. If he has wronged you at all\, or owes you anything\, charge that to my account. I\, Paul\, write this with my own hand\, I will repay it - to say nothing of your owing me even your own self. Yes\, brother\, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ. Confident of your obedience\, I write to you\, knowing that you will do even more than I say. At the same time\, prepare a guest room for me\, for I am hoping through your prayers to be granted to you. Epaphras\, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus\, sends greetings to you\, and so do Mark\, Aristarchos\, Demas\, and Luke\, my fellow workers. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 19:12-28\nThe Lord said this parable\, \"A nobleman went into a far country to receive a kingdom and then return. Calling ten of his servants\, he gave them ten pounds\, and said to them\, 'Trade with these till I come.' But his citizens hated him and sent an embassy after him\, saying\, 'We do not want this man to reign over us.' When he returned\, having received the kingdom\, he commanded these servants\, to whom he had given the money\, to be called to him\, that he might know what they had gained by trading. The first came before him\, saying\, 'Lord\, your pound has made ten pounds more.' And he said to him\, 'Well done\, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very little\, you shall have authority over ten cities.' And the second came\, saying\, 'Lord\, your pound has made five pounds.' And he said to him\, 'And you are to be over five cities.' Then another came\, saying\, 'Lord\, here is your pound\, which I kept laid away in a napkin; for I was afraid of you\, because you are a severe man; you take up what you did not lay down\, and reap what you did not sow.' He said to him\, 'I will condemn you out of your own mouth\, you wicked servant! You knew that I was a severe man\, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow? Why then did you not put my money into the bank\, and at my coming I should have collected it with interest?' And he said to those who stood by\, 'Take the pound from him\, and give it to him who has the ten pounds.' (And they said to him\, 'Lord\, he has ten pounds!') 'I tell you\, that to every one who has will more be given; but from him who has not\, even what he has will be taken away. But as for these enemies of mine\, who did not want me to reign over them\, bring them here and slay them before me.'\" And when he had said this\, he went on ahead\, going up to Jerusalem.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 11/23/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Amphilochius\, Bishop of Iconium; Gregory\, Bishop of Agrigentum; Dionysios\, Patriarch of Constantinople; Ischyrion\, Bishop of Egypt; Afterfeast of the Entry of the Theotokos into the Temple; Sisinios the Confessor\n\nFast Day (Fish Allowed)\n\nEpistle Reading: II Corinthians 5:1-10\nBrethren\, we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed\, we have a building from God\, a house not made with hands\, eternal in the heavens. Here indeed we groan\, and long to put on our heavenly dwelling\, so that by putting it on we may not be found naked. For while we are still in this tent\, we sigh with anxiety; not that we would be unclothed\, but that we would be further clothed\, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. He who has prepared us for this very thing is God\, who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee.\n\nSo we are always of good courage; we know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord\, for we walk by faith\, not by sight. We are of good courage\, and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord. So whether we are at home or away\, we make it our aim to please him. For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 10:19-21\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"Behold\, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions\, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall hurt you. Nevertheless do not rejoice in this\, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.\" In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said\, \"I thank you\, Father\, Lord of heaven and earth\, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes; yes\, Father\, for such was your gracious will.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:13th Sunday of Luke
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 11/24/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: 13th Sunday of Luke; Our Holy Father Clement\, Pope of Rome; Peter\, Archbishop of Alexandria; Hermogenes\, the Martyr; Afterfeast of the Entry of the Theotokos into the Temple; Philoumenos and Christopher the Martyrs\n\nFast Day (Fish Allowed)\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: John 21:14-25\nAt that time\, Jesus revealed himself to the disciples after he was raised from the dead. And he said to Simon Peter\, \"Simon\, son of John\, do you love me more than these?\" He said to him\, \"Yes\, Lord; you know that I love you.\" He said to him\, \"Feed my lambs.\" A second time he said to him\, \"Simon\, son of John\, do you love me?\" He said to him\, \"Yes\, Lord; you know that I love you.\" He said to him\, \"Tend my sheep.\" He said to him the third time\, \"Simon\, son of John\, do you love me?\" Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time\, \"Do you love me?\" And he said to him\, \"Lord\, you know everything; you know that I love you.\" Jesus said to him\, \"Feed my sheep. Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, when you were young\, you girded yourself and walked where you would; but when you are old\, you will stretch out your hands\, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go.\" (This he said to show by what death he was to glorify God.) And after this he said to him\, \"Follow me.\" Peter turned and saw following them the disciple whom Jesus loved\, who had lain close to his breast at the supper and had said\, \"Lord\, who is it that is going to betray you?\" When Peter saw him\, he said to Jesus\, \"Lord\, what about this man?\" Jesus said to him\, \"If it is my will that he remain until I come\, what is that to you? Follow me!\" The saying spread abroad among the brethren that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die\, but\, \"If it is my will that he remain until I come\, what is that to you?\" This is the disciple who is bearing witness to these things\, and who has written these things; and we know that his testimony is true. But there are also many other things which Jesus did; were every one of them to be written\, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen.\n\nEpistle Reading: Galatians 6:11-18\nBrethren\, see with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand. It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh that would compel you to be circumcised\, and only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. For even those who receive circumcision do not themselves keep the law\, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh. But far be it from me to glory except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ\, by which the world has been crucified to me\, and I to the world. For neither circumcision counts for anything\, nor uncircumcision\, but a new creation. Peace and mercy be upon all who walk by this rule\, upon the Israel of God. Henceforth let no man trouble me; for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit\, brethren. Amen.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 18:18-27\nAt that time\, a ruler came to Jesus and asked him\, \"Good Teacher\, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\" And Jesus said to him\, \"Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. You know the commandments: 'Do not commit adultery\, Do not kill\, Do not steal\, Do not bear false witness\, Honor your father and mother.' \" And he said\, \"All these I have observed from my youth.\" And when Jesus heard it\, he said to him\, \"One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute it to the poor\, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come\, follow me.\" But when he heard this he became sad\, for he was very rich. Jesus looking at him said\, \"How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God! For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\" Those who heard it said\, \"Then who can be saved?\" But he said\, \"What is impossible with men is possible with God.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Catherine the Great Martyr of Alexandria
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 11/25/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Catherine the Great Martyr of Alexandria; Apodosis of the Presentation of the Theotokos into the Temple; Mercurius the Great Martyr of Caesarea in Cappadocia\n\nFast Day (Fish Allowed)\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Matthew 25:1-13\nThe Lord said this parable\, \"The kingdom of heaven shall be compared to ten maidens who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish\, and five were wise. For when the foolish took their lamps\, they took no oil with them; but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps. As the bridegroom was delayed\, they all slumbered and slept. But at midnight there was a cry\, 'Behold\, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.' Then all those maidens rose and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said to the wise\, 'Give us some of your oil\, for our lamps are going out.' But the wise replied\, 'Perhaps there will not be enough for us and for you; go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.' And while they went to buy\, the bridegroom came\, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast; and the door was shut. Afterward the other maidens came also\, saying\, 'Lord\, lord\, open to us.' But he replied\, 'Truly\, I say to you\, I do not know you.' Watch therefore\, for you know neither the day nor the hour in which the Son of man will come.\"\n\nEpistle Reading: Galatians 3:23-29;4:1-5\nBrethren\, before faith came\, we were confined under the law\, kept under restraint until faith should be revealed. So that the law was our custodian until Christ came\, that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come\, we are no longer under a custodian; for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God\, through faith. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek\, there is neither slave nor free\, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you are Christ's\, then you are Abraham's offspring\, heirs according to promise. I mean that the heir\, as long as he is a child\, is no better than a slave\, though he is the owner of all the estate; but he is under guardians and trustees until the date set by the father. So with us; when we were children\, we were slaves to the elemental spirits of the universe. But when the time had fully come\, God sent forth his Son\, born of a woman\, born under the law\, to redeem those who were under the law\, so that we might receive adoption as sons.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 5:24-34\nAt that time\, a great crowd followed Jesus and thronged about him. And there was a woman who had had a flow of blood for twelve years\, and who had suffered much under many physicians\, and had spent all that she had\, and was no better but rather grew worse. She had heard the reports about Jesus\, and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment. For she said\, \"If I touch even his garments\, I shall be made well.\" And immediately the hemorrhage ceased; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. And Jesus\, perceiving in himself that power had gone forth from him\, immediately turned about in the crowd\, and said\, \"Who touched my garments?\" And his disciples said to him\, \"You see the crowd pressing around you\, and yet you say\, 'Who touched me?'\" And he looked around to see who had done it. But the woman\, knowing what had been done to her\, came in fear and trembling and fell down before him\, and told him the whole truth. And he said to her\, \"Daughter\, your faith has made you well; go in peace\, and be healed of your disease.\"\n\n

For not only has the word of the Lord sounded forth from you in Macedonia and Achaia\, but your faith in God has gone forth everywhere\, so that we need not say anything. For they themselves report concerning us what a welcome we had among you\, and how you turned to God from idols\, to serve a living and true God\, and to wait for his Son from heaven\, whom he raised from the dead\, Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 19:45-48\nAt that time\, Jesus entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold\, saying to them\, \"It is written\, 'My house shall be a house of prayer'; but you have made it a den of robbers.\" And he was teaching daily in the temple. The chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people sought to destroy him; but they did not find anything they could do\, for all the people hung upon his words.\n\n

For our appeal does not spring from error or uncleanness\, nor is it made with guile; but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel\, so we speak\, not to please men\, but to please God who tests our hearts. For we never used either words of flattery\, as you know\, or a cloak for greed\, as God is witness; nor did we seek glory from men\, whether from you or from others\, though we might have made demands as apostles of Christ. But we were gentle among you\, like a nurse taking care of her children. So\, being affectionately desirous of you\, we were ready to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our very own selves\, because you had become very dear to us.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 20:1-8\nAt that time\, as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel\, the chief priests and the scribes with the elders came up and said to Him\, \"Tell us by what authority you do these things\, or who it is that gave you this authority.\"  He answered them\, \"I also will ask you a question; now tell me\, was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?\"  And they discussed it with one another\, saying\, \"If we say\, 'From heaven\,' he will say\, 'Why did you not believe him?'  But if we say\, 'From men\,' all the people will stone us; for they are convinced that John was a prophet.\"  So they answered that they did not know whence it was.  And Jesus said to them\, \"Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.\"\n\n

You are witnesses\, and God also\, how holy and righteous and blameless was our behavior to you believers; for you know how\, like a father with his children\, we exhorted each one of you and encouraged you and charged you to lead a life worthy of God\, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory. And we also thank God constantly for this\, that when you received the word of God which you heard from us\, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is\, the word of God\, which is at work in you believers. For you\, brethren\, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus which are in Judea.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 20:9-18\nThe Lord said this parable: \"A man planted a vineyard\, and let it out to tenants\, and went into another country for a long while. When the time came\, he sent a servant to the tenants\, that they should give him some of the fruit of the vineyard; but the tenants beat him\, and sent him away empty-handed. And he sent another servant; him also they beat and treated shamefully\, and sent him away empty-handed. And he sent yet a third; this one they wounded and cast out. Then the owner of the vineyard said\, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; it may be they will respect him.' But when the tenants saw him\, they said to themselves\, 'This is the heir; let us kill him\, that the inheritance may be ours.' And they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them? He will come and destroy those tenants\, and give the vineyard to others.\" When they heard this\, they said\, \"God forbid!\" But he looked at them and said\, \"What then is this that is written: 'The very stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner'? Every one who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; but when it falls on any one it will crush him.\"\n\n

But God's wrath has come upon them at last! But since we were bereft of you\, brethren\, for a short time\, in person not in heart\, we endeavored the more eagerly and with great desire to see you face to face; because we wanted to come to you - I\, Paul\, again and again - but Satan hindered us. For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not you? For you are our glory and joy.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 20:19-26\nAt that time\, the scribes and the chief priests tried to lay hands on Jesus at that very hour\, but they feared the people; for they perceived that he had told this parable against them. So they watched him\, and sent spies\, who pretended to be sincere\, that they might take hold of what he said\, so as to deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor. They asked him\, \"Teacher\, we know that you speak and teach rightly\, and show no partiality\, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar\, or not?\" But he perceived their craftiness\, and said to them\, \"Show me a coin. Whose likeness and inscription has it?\" They said\, \"Caesar's.\" He said to them\, \"Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's\, and to God the things that are God's.\" And they were not able in the presence of the people to catch him by what he said; but marveling at his answer they were silent.\n\n

And he said to them\, \"Follow me\, and I will make you fishers of men.\" Immediately they left their nets and followed him. And going on from there he saw two other brothers\, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother\, in the boat with Zebedee their father\, mending their nets\, and he called them. Immediately they left their boat and their father\, and followed him. And he went about all Galilee\, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every infirmity among the people.\n\nEpistle Reading: I Corinthians 4:9-16\nBrethren\, God has exhibited us apostles as last of all\, like men sentenced to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world\, to angels and to men. We are fools for Christ's sake\, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak\, but you are strong. You are held in honor\, but we in disrepute. To the present hour we hunger and thirst\, we are ill-clad and buffeted and homeless\, and we labor\, working with our own hands. When reviled\, we bless; when persecuted\, we endure; when slandered\, we try to conciliate; we have become\, and are now\, as the refuse of the world\, the off-scouring of all things. I do not write this to make you ashamed\, but to admonish you as my beloved children. For though you have countless guides in Christ\, you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel. I urge you\, then\, be imitators of me.\n\nGospel Reading: John 1:35-51\nAt that time\, John was standing with two of his disciples; and he looked at Jesus as he walked\, and said\, \"Behold\, the Lamb of God!\" The two disciples heard him say this\, and they followed Jesus. Jesus turned\, and saw them following\, and said to them\, \"What do you seek?\" And they said to him\, \"Rabbi\" (which means Teacher)\, \"Where are you staying?\" He said to them\, \"Come and see.\" They came and saw where he was staying; and they stayed with him that day\, for it was about the tenth hour. One of the two who heard John speak\, and followed him\, was Andrew\, Simon Peter's brother. He first found his brother Simon\, and said to him\, \"We have found the Messiah\" (which means Christ). He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him\, and said\, \"So you are Simon the son of John? You shall be called Cephas\" (which means Peter). \n\n The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. And he found Philip and said to him\, \"Follow me.\" Now Philip was from Bethsaida\, the city of Andrew and Peter. Philip found Nathanael\, and said to him\, \"We have found him of whom Moses in the law and also the prophets wrote\, Jesus of Nazareth\, the son of Joseph.\" Nathanael said to him\, \"Can anything good come out of Nazareth?\" Philip said to him\, \"Come and see.\" Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him\, and said of him\, \"Behold\, an Israelite indeed\, in whom is no guile! \" Nathanael said to him\, \"How do you know me?\" Jesus answered him\, \"Before Philip called you\, when you were under the fig tree\, I saw you.\" Nathanael answered him\, \"Rabbi\, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!\" Jesus answered him\, \"Because I said to you\, I saw you under the fig tree\, do you believe? You shall see greater things than these.\" And he said to him\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, you will see heaven opened\, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.\"\n\n

And when they saw Him they worshiped Him; but some doubted. And Jesus came and said to them\, \"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations\, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit\, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo\, I am with you always\, to the close of the age. Amen.\"\n\nEpistle Reading: Ephesians 2:4-10\nBrethren\, God who is rich in mercy\, out of the great love with which he loved us\, even when we were dead through our trespasses\, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved)\, and raised us up with him\, and made us sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus\, that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith; and this is not your own doing\, it is the gift of God: not because of works\, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship\, created in Christ Jesus for good works\, which God prepared beforehand\, that we should walk in them.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 18:35-43\nAt that time\, as Jesus drew near to Jericho\, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging; and hearing a multitude going by\, he inquired what this meant. They told him\, \"Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.\" And he cried\, \"Jesus\, Son of David\, have mercy on me!\" And those who were in front rebuked him\, telling him to be silent; but he cried out all the more\, \"Son of David\, have mercy on me!\" And Jesus stopped\, and commanded him to be brought to him; and when he came near\, he asked him\, \"What do you want me to do for you?\" He said\, \"Lord\, let me receive my sight.\" And Jesus said to him\, \"Receive your sight; your faith has made you well.\" And immediately he received his sight and followed him\, glorifying God; and all the people\, when they saw it\, gave praise to God.\n\n

For this reason\, when I could bear it no longer\, I sent that I might know your faith\, for fear that somehow the tempter had tempted you and that our labor would be in vain. But now that Timothy has come to us from you\, and has brought us the good news of your faith and love and reported that you always remember us kindly and long to see us\, as we long to see you - for this reason\, brethren\, in all our distress and affliction we have been comforted about you through your faith; for now we live\, if you stand fast in the Lord.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 20:27-44\nAt that time\, there came to Jesus some Sadducees\, those who say that there is no resurrection\, and they asked him a question\, saying\, \"Teacher\, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies\, having a wife but no children\, the man must take the wife and raise up children for his brother. Now there were seven brothers; the first took a wife\, and died without children; and the second and the third took her\, and likewise all seven left no children and died. Afterward the woman also died. In the resurrection\, therefore\, whose wife will the woman be? For the seven had her as wife.\" And Jesus said to them\, \"The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage; but those who are accounted worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage\, for they cannot die any more\, because they are equal to angels and are sons of God\, being sons of the resurrection. But that the dead are raised\, even Moses showed\, in the passage about the bush\, where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. Now he is not God of the dead\, but of the living; for all live to him.\" And some of the scribes answered\, \"Teacher\, you have spoken well.\" For they no longer dared to ask him any question. But he said to them\, \"How can they say that the Christ is David's son? For David himself says in the Book of Psalms\, 'The Lord said to my Lord\, Sit at my right hand\, till I make thy enemies a stool for thy feet.' David thus calls him Lord; so how is he his son?\"\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 12/04/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Barbara the Great Martyr; John the Righteous of Damascus; New Hieromartyr Seraphim\, Bishop of the Phanar in Greece; Juliana the Martyr of Heliopolis; Alexander Hotovitzky\, New Hieromartyr of Russia\, Missionary to America\n\nFast Day (Wine and Oil Allowed)\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Matthew 25:1-13\nThe Lord said this parable\, \"The kingdom of heaven shall be compared to ten maidens who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish\, and five were wise. For when the foolish took their lamps\, they took no oil with them; but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps. As the bridegroom was delayed\, they all slumbered and slept. But at midnight there was a cry\, 'Behold\, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.' Then all those maidens rose and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said to the wise\, 'Give us some of your oil\, for our lamps are going out.' But the wise replied\, 'Perhaps there will not be enough for us and for you; go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.' And while they went to buy\, the bridegroom came\, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast; and the door was shut. Afterward the other maidens came also\, saying\, 'Lord\, lord\, open to us.' But he replied\, 'Truly\, I say to you\, I do not know you.' Watch therefore\, for you know neither the day nor the hour in which the Son of man will come.\"\n\nEpistle Reading: Galatians 3:23-29;4:1-5\nBrethren\, before faith came\, we were confined under the law\, kept under restraint until faith should be revealed. So that the law was our custodian until Christ came\, that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come\, we are no longer under a custodian; for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God\, through faith. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek\, there is neither slave nor free\, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you are Christ's\, then you are Abraham's offspring\, heirs according to promise. I mean that the heir\, as long as he is a child\, is no better than a slave\, though he is the owner of all the estate; but he is under guardians and trustees until the date set by the father. So with us; when we were children\, we were slaves to the elemental spirits of the universe. But when the time had fully come\, God sent forth his Son\, born of a woman\, born under the law\, to redeem those who were under the law\, so that we might receive adoption as sons.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 5:24-34\nAt that time\, a great crowd followed Jesus and thronged about him. And there was a woman who had had a flow of blood for twelve years\, and who had suffered much under many physicians\, and had spent all that she had\, and was no better but rather grew worse. She had heard the reports about Jesus\, and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment. For she said\, \"If I touch even his garments\, I shall be made well.\" And immediately the hemorrhage ceased; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. And Jesus\, perceiving in himself that power had gone forth from him\, immediately turned about in the crowd\, and said\, \"Who touched my garments?\" And his disciples said to him\, \"You see the crowd pressing around you\, and yet you say\, 'Who touched me?'\" And he looked around to see who had done it. But the woman\, knowing what had been done to her\, came in fear and trembling and fell down before him\, and told him the whole truth. And he said to her\, \"Daughter\, your faith has made you well; go in peace\, and be healed of your disease.\"\n\n

And all the crowd sought to touch him\, for power came forth from him and healed them all.

Rejoice in that day\, and leap for joy\, for behold\, your reward is great in heaven.\"\n\nEpistle Reading: Galatians 5:22-26;6:1-2\nBrethren\, the fruit of the Spirit is love\, joy\, peace\, patience\, kindness\, goodness\, faithfulness\, gentleness\, self-control; against such there is no law.  And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.  If we live by the Spirit\, let us also walk by the Spirit.  Let us have no self-conceit\, no provoking of one another\, no envy of one another.  Brethren\, if a man is overtaken in any trespass\, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness.  Look to yourself\, lest you too be tempted.  Bear one another's burdens\, and so fulfill the law of Christ.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 11:27-30\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"All things have been delivered to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father\, and no one knows the Father except the Son and any one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.  Come to me\, all who labor and are heavy laden\, and I will give you rest.  Take my yoke upon you\, and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart\, and you will find rest for your souls.  For my yoke is easy\, and my burden is light.\"\n\n

Let them do this joyfully\, and not sadly\, for that would be of no advantage to you.  Pray for us\, for we are sure that we have a clear conscience\, desiring to act honorably in all things.  I urge you the more earnestly to do this in order that I may be restored to you the sooner.

Do bear with me! I feel a divine jealousy for you\, for I betrothed you to Christ to present you as a pure bride to her one husband. But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning\, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ. For if some one comes and preaches another Jesus than the one we preached\, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received\, or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted\, you submit to it readily enough. I think that I am not in the least inferior to these superlative apostles. Even if I am unskilled in speaking\, I am not in knowledge; in every way we have made this plain to you in all things.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 13:19-29\nThe Lord said this parable\, \"The kingdom of God is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his garden; and it grew and became a tree\, and the birds of the air made nests in its branches.\" And again he said\, \"To what shall I compare the kingdom of God? It is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour\, till it was all leavened.\" He went on his way through towns and villages\, teaching\, and journeying toward Jerusalem. And some one said to him\, \"Lord\, will those who are saved be few?\" And he said to them\, \"Strive to enter by the narrow door; for many\, I tell you\, will seek to enter and will not be able. When once the householder has risen up and shut the door\, you will begin to stand outside and to knock at the door\, saying\, 'Lord\, open to us.' He will answer you\, 'I do not know where you come from.' Then you will begin to say\, 'We ate and drank in your presence\, and you taught in our streets.' But he will say\, 'I tell you\, I do not know where you come from; depart from me\, all you workers of iniquity!' There you will weep and gnash your teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God and you yourselves thrust out. And men will come from east and west\, and from north and south\, and sit at table in the kingdom of God.\"\n\n

And very early on the first day of the week they went to the tomb when the sun had risen. And they were saying to one another\, \"Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the tomb?\" And looking up\, they saw that the stone was rolled back - it was very large. And entering the tomb\, they saw a young man sitting on the right side\, dressed in a white robe; and they were amazed. And he said to them\, \"Do not be amazed; you seek Jesus of Nazareth\, who was crucified. He has risen\, He is not here; see the place where they laid Him. But go\, tell His disciples and Peter that He is going before you to Galilee; there you will see Him\, as He told you.\" And they went out and fled from the tomb\, for trembling and astonishment had come upon them; and they said nothing to anyone\, for they were afraid.\n\nEpistle Reading: Ephesians 2:14-22\nBrethren\, Christ is our peace\, who has made us both one\, and has broken down the dividing wall of hostility\, by abolishing in his flesh the law of commandments and ordinances\, that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two\, so making peace\, and might reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross\, thereby bringing the hostility to an end. And he came and preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near; for through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father. So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners\, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God\, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets\, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone\, in whom the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you also are built into it for a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 13:10-17\nAt that time\, Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath. And there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity for eighteen years; she was bent over and could not fully straighten herself. And when Jesus saw her\, he called her and said to her\, \"Woman\, you are freed from your infirmity.\" And he laid his hands upon her\, and immediately she was made straight\, and she praised God. But the ruler of the synagogue\, indignant because Jesus had healed on the sabbath\, said to the people\, \"There are six days on which work ought to be done; come on those days and be healed\, and not on the sabbath day.\" Then the Lord answered him\, \"You hypocrites! Does not each of you on the sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger\, and lead it away to water it? And ought not this woman\, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen years\, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?\" As he said this\, all his adversaries were put to shame; and all the people rejoiced at all the glorious things that were done by him.\n\n

But the son of the slave was born according to the flesh\, the son of the free woman through promise. Now this is an allegory: these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai\, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar. Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; she corresponds to the present Jerusalem\, for she is in slavery with her children. But the Jerusalem above is free\, and she is our mother. For it is written\, \"Rejoice\, O barren one who does not bear; break forth and shout\, you who are not in travail; for the children of the desolate one are many more than the children of her that is married.\"\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 8:16-21\nThe Lord said\, \"No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a vessel\, or puts it under a bed\, but puts it on a stand\, that those who enter may see the light. For nothing is hid that shall not be made manifest\, nor anything secret that shall not be known and come to light. Take heed then how you hear; for to him who has will more be given\, and from him who has not\, even what he thinks that he has will be taken away.\"\n\nThen his mother and his brothers came to him\, but they could not reach him for the crowd. And he was told\, \"Your mother and your brothers are standing outside\, desiring to see you.\" But he said to them\, \"My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.\"\n\n

Let no one deceive you in any way; for that day will not come\, unless the rebellion comes first\, and the man of lawlessness is revealed\, the son of perdition\, who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship\, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God\, proclaiming himself to be God. Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you this? And you know what is restraining him now so that he may be revealed in his time. For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way. And then the lawless one will be revealed\, and the Lord Jesus will slay him with the breath of his mouth and destroy him by his appearing and his coming. The coming of the lawless one by the activity of Satan will be with all power and with pretended signs and wonders\, and with all wicked deception for those who are to perish\, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. Therefore God sends upon them a strong delusion\, to make them believe what is false\, so that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 8:30-34\nAt that time\, Jesus charged his disciples to tell no one about him\, that he is the Christ. And he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things\, and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes\, and be killed\, and after three days rise again. And he said this plainly. And Peter took him\, and began to rebuke him. But turning and seeing his disciples\, he rebuked Peter\, and said\, \"Get behind me\, Satan! For you are not on the side of God\, but of men.\" And he called to him the multitude with his disciples\, and said to them\, \"If any man would come after me\, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.\"\n\n

Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness\, but instead expose them. For it is a shame even to speak of the things that they do in secret; but when anything is exposed by the light it becomes visible\, for anything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it is said\, \"Awake\, O sleeper\, and arise from the dead\, and Christ shall give you light.\" Look carefully then how you walk\, not as unwise men but as wise\, making the most of the time\, because the days are evil. Therefore do not be foolish\, but understand what the will of the Lord is. And do not get drunk with wine\, for that is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit\, addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs\, singing and making melody to the Lord with all your heart.\n\nGospel Reading: John 10:9-16\nThe Lord said\, \"I am the door; if any one enters by me\, he will be saved\, and will go in and out and find pasture.  The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came that they may have life\, and have it abundantly.  I am the good shepherd.  The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.  He who is a hireling and not a shepherd\, whose own the sheep are not\, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.  He flees because he is a hireling and cares nothing for the sheep.  I am the good shepherd; I know my own and my own know me\, as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.  And I have other sheep\, that are not of this fold; I must bring them also\, and they will heed my voice. So there shall be one flock\, one shepherd.\"\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 12/13/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Martyrs Eustratius\, Auxentius\, Eugene\, Mardarius\, and Orestes of Greater Armenia; Lucia the Virgin-martyr; Herman the Wonderworker of Alaska & First Saint of America; Gabriel the Hieromartyr\, Archbishop of Serbia\n\nStrict Fast\n\nEpistle Reading: II Thessalonians 3:6-18\nBrethren\, we command you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ\, that you keep away from any brother who is living in idleness and not in accord with the tradition that you received from us. For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us; we were not idle when we were with you\, we did not eat any one's bread without paying\, but with toil and labor we worked night and day\, that we might not burden any of you. It was not because we have not that right\, but to give you in our conduct an example to imitate. For even when we were with you\, we gave you this command: If any one will not work\, let him not eat. For we hear that some of you are living in idleness\, mere busybodies\, not doing any work. Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work in quietness and to earn their own living. Brethren\, do not be weary in well-doing.\n\nIf any one refuses to obey what we say in this letter\, note that man\, and have nothing to do with him\, that he may be ashamed. Do not look on him as an enemy\, but warn him as a brother.\n\nNow may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with you all. I\, Paul\, write this greeting with my own hand. This is the mark in every letter of mine; it is the way I write. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 9:33-41\nAt that time\, Jesus and his disciples came to Capernaum\, and when he was in the house he asked them\, \"What were you discussing on the way?\"  But they were silent; for on the way they had discussed with one another who was the greatest.  And he sat down and called the twelve; and he said to them\, \"If any one would be first\, he must be last of all and servant of all.\"  And he took a child\, and put him in the midst of them; and taking him in his arms\, he said to them\, \"Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me; and whoever receives me\, receives not me but him who sent me.\"  John said to him\, \"Teacher\, we saw a man casting out demons in your name\, and we forbade him\, because he was not following us.\"  But Jesus said\, \"Do not forbid him; for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soon after to speak evil of me.  For he that is not against us is for us.  For truly\, I say to you\, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you bear the name of Christ\, will by no means lose his reward.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Martyrs Thyrsus\, Leucius\, and Callinicus of Asia Minor\, and Philemon\, Apollonius\, and Arian of Alexandria
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 12/14/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Martyrs Thyrsus\, Leucius\, and Callinicus of Asia Minor\, and Philemon\, Apollonius\, and Arian of Alexandria\n\nFast Day (Wine and Oil Allowed)\n\nEpistle Reading: Galatians 1:3-10\nBrethren\, grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ\, who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present evil age\, according to the will of our God and Father; to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen. I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and turning to a different gospel - not that there is another gospel\, but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. But even if we\, or an angel of heaven\, should preach to you a gospel contrary to that which we preached to you\, let him be accursed. As we have said before\, so now I say again\, If any one is preaching to you a gospel contrary to that which you received\, let him be accursed. Am I now seeking the favor of men\, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still pleasing men\, I should not be a servant of Christ.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 14:1-11\nAt that time\, one sabbath when Jesus went to dine at the house of a ruler who belonged to the Pharisees\, they were watching him. And behold\, there was a man before him who had dropsy. And Jesus spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees\, saying\, \"Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath\, or not?\" But they were silent. Then he took him and healed him\, and let him go. And he said to them\, \"Which of you\, having a son or an ox that has fallen into a well\, will not immediately pull him out on a sabbath day?\" And they could not reply to this. Now he told a parable to those who were invited\, when he marked how they chose the places of honor\, saying to them\, \"When you are invited by any one to a marriage feast\, do not sit down in a place of honor\, lest a more eminent man than you be invited by him; and he who invited you both will come and say to you\, 'Give place to this man\,' and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place. But when you are invited\, go and sit in the lowest place\, so that when your host comes he may say to you\, 'Friend\, go up higher'; then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at table with you. For every one who exalts himself will be humbled\, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:11th Sunday of Luke
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 12/15/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: 11th Sunday of Luke; Eleutherios the Hieromartyr\, Bishop of Illyricum\, and his mother Anthia; The Martyr Susannah the Deaconess\n\nFast Day (Wine and Oil Allowed)\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Mark 16:9-20\nWhen Jesus rose early on the first day of the week\, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene\, from whom He had cast out seven demons. She went and told those who had been with Him\, as they mourned and wept. But when they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her\, they would not believe it.\n\nAfter this he appeared in another form to two of them\, as they were walking into the country. And they went back and told the rest\, but they did not believe them. After this He appeared to the eleven themselves as they sat at table and He upbraided them for their unbelief and hardness of heart\, because they had not believed those who saw Him after He had risen. And He said to them\, \"Go into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation. He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned. And these signs will accompany those who believe: in My name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents\, and if they drink any deadly thing\, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick\, and they will recover.\"\n\nSo then the Lord Jesus\, after He had spoken to them\, was taken up into heaven\, and sat down at the right hand of God. And they went forth and preached everywhere\, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that attended it. Amen.\n\nEpistle Reading: II Timothy 1:8-18\nTIMOTHY\, my son\, do not be ashamed then of testifying to our Lord\, nor of me his prisoner\, but share in suffering for the gospel in the power of God\, who saved us and called us with a holy calling\, not in virtue of our works but in virtue of his own purpose and the grace which he gave us in Christ Jesus ages ago\, and now has manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus\, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. For this gospel I was appointed a preacher and apostle and teacher\, and therefore I suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed\, for I know whom I have believed\, and I am sure that he is able to guard until that Day what has been entrusted to me. Follow the pattern of the sound words which you have heard from me\, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus; guard the truth that has been entrusted to you by the Holy Spirit who dwells within us.\n\nYou are aware that all who are in Asia turned away from me\, and among them Phygelos and Hermogenes. May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphoros\, for he often refreshed me; he was not ashamed of my chains\, but when he arrived in Rome he searched for me eagerly and found me -  may the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that Day and you well know all the service he rendered at Ephesos.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 14:16-24\nThe Lord said this parable: \"A man once gave a great banquet\, and invited many; and at the time of the banquet he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited\, 'Come; for all is now ready.' But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him\, 'I have bought a field\, and I go out and see it; I pray you\, have me excused.' And another said\, 'I have bought five yoke of oxen\, and I must go to examine them; I pray you\, have me excused.' And another said\, 'I have married a wife\, and therefore I cannot come.' So the servant came and reported this to his master. Then the householder in anger said to his servant\, 'Go out quickly to the streets and lanes of the city\, and bring in the poor and maimed and blind and lame.' And the servant said\, 'Sir\, what you commanded has been done\, and there is still room.' And the master said to the servant\, 'Go out to the highways and hedges\, and compel people to come in\, that my house may be filled. For I tell you\, none of those men who were invited shall taste my banquet. For many are called\, but few are chosen.'\"\n\n

SUMMARY:The Holy Prophet Aggaeus (Haggai)
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 12/16/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: The Holy Prophet Aggaeus (Haggai); Modestos\, Archbishop of Jerusalem; Our Righteous Mother Blessed Empress Theophania; Nicholas Chrysoberges\, Patriarch of Constantinople; Memnonus\, Archbishop of Ephesus\n\nStrict Fast\n\nEpistle Reading: I Timothy 1:1-7\nPaul\, an apostle of Christ Jesus by command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope\, to Timothy\, my true child in the faith: Grace\, mercy\, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. As I urged you when I was going to Macedonia\, remain at Ephesos that you may charge certain persons not to teach any different doctrine\, nor to occupy themselves with myths and endless genealogies which promote speculations rather than the divine training that is in faith; whereas the aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith. Certain persons by swerving from these have wandered away into vain discussion\, desiring to be teachers of the law\, without understanding either what they are saying or the things about which they make assertions.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 9:42-50; 10:1\nThe Lord said\, \"Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin\, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung round his neck and he were thrown into the sea. And if your hand causes you to sin\, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go to hell\, to the unquenchable fire\, where their worm does not die\, and the fire is not quenched. And if your foot causes you to sin\, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell\, where their worm does not die\, and the fire is not quenched. And if your eye causes you to sin\, pluck it out; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell\, where their worm does not die\, and the fire is not quenched. For every one will be salted with fire and every sacrifice will be salted with salt. Salt is good; but if the salt has lost its saltness\, how will you season it? Have salt in yourselves\, and be at peace with one another.\" And he left there and went to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan\, and crowds gathered to him again; and again\, as his custom was\, he taught them.\n\n

SUMMARY:Daniel the Prophet & Ananias\, Azarias\, & Misail\, the Three Holy Youths
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 12/17/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Daniel the Prophet & Ananias\, Azarias\, & Misail\, the Three Holy Youths; Dionysius of Zakynthos\n\nFast Day (Wine and Oil Allowed)\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 11:33-40;12:1-2\nBrethren\, all the saints through faith conquered kingdoms\, enforced justice\, received promises\, stopped the mouths of lions\, quenched raging fire\, escaped the edge of the sword\, won strength out of weakness\, became mighty in war\, put foreign armies to flight. Women received their dead by resurrection. Some were tortured\, refusing to accept release\, that they might rise again to a better life. Others suffered mocking and scourging\, and even chains and imprisonment. They were stoned\, they were sawn in two\, they were tempted\, they were killed with the sword; they went about in skins of sheep and goats\, destitute\, afflicted\, ill-treated - of whom the world was not worthy - wandering         over deserts and mountains and in dens and caves of the earth. And all these\, though well attested by their faith\, did not receive what was promised\, since God had foreseen something better for us\, that apart from us they should not be made perfect. Therefore\, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses\, let us also lay aside every weight\, and sin which clings so closely\, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us\, looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 10:2-12\nAt that time\, the Pharisees came up to Jesus and in order to test him\, asked\, \"Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?\" He answered them\, \"What did Moses command you?\" They said\, \"Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce\, and to put her away.\" But Jesus said to them\, \"For your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment. But from the beginning of creation\, 'God made them male and female. For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife\, and the two shall become one flesh.' So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together\, let not man put asunder.\" And in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter. And he said to them\, \"Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her; and if she divorces her husband and marries another\, she commits adultery.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Sebastian the Martyr & his Companions
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 12/18/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Sebastian the Martyr & his Companions; Our Righteous Father Michael Syngellon the Confessor\n\nStrict Fast\n\nEpistle Reading: I Timothy 1:18-20;2:8-15\nTimothy\, my son\, this charge I commit to you in accordance with the prophetic utterances which pointed to you\, that inspired by them you may wage the good warfare\, holding faith and a good conscience. By rejecting conscience\, certain persons have made shipwreck of their faith\, among them Hymenaios and Alexander\, whom I have delivered to Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme. I desire then that in every place the men should pray\, lifting holy hands without anger or quarreling; also that women should adorn themselves modestly and sensibly in seemly apparel\, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly attire but by good deeds\, as befits women who profess religion. Let a woman learn in silence with all submissiveness. I permit no woman to teach or to have authority over men; she is to keep silent. For Adam was formed first\, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived\, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor. Yet woman will be saved through bearing children\, if she continues in faith and love and holiness\, with modesty.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 10:11-16\nThe Lord said\, \"Whoever divorces his wife and marries another\, commits adultery against her; and if she divorces her husband and marries another\, she commits adultery.\" And they were bringing children to him\, that he might touch them; and the disciples rebuked them. But when Jesus saw it he was indignant\, and said to them\, \"Let the children come to me\, do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Truly\, I say to you\, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.\" And he took them in his arms and blessed them\, laying his hands upon them.\n\n

SUMMARY:Martyrs Boniface\, Probus\, Ares\, Timothy\, Polyeuktos\, Eutychios and Thessaloniki
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 12/19/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Martyrs Boniface\, Probus\, Ares\, Timothy\, Polyeuktos\, Eutychios and Thessaloniki; Our Righteous Father Gregentius\, Bishop of Ethiopia; Aglaia the Righteous of Rome\n\nStrict Fast\n\nEpistle Reading: I Timothy 3:1-13\nTimothy\, my son\, the saying is sure: If any one aspires to the office of bishop\, he desires a noble task. Now a bishop must be above reproach\, the husband of one wife\, temperate\, sensible\, dignified\, hospitable\, an apt teacher\, no drunkard\, not violent but gentle\, not quarrelsome\, and no lover of money. He must manage his own household well\, keeping his children submissive and respectful in every way; for if a man does not know how to manage his own household\, how can he care for God's church? He must not be a recent convert\, or he may be puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil; moreover he must be well thought of by outsiders\, or he may fall into reproach and the snare of the devil. Deacons likewise must be serious\, not double-tongued\, not addicted to much wine\, not greedy for gain; they must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience. And let them also be tested first; then if they prove themselves blameless let them serve as deacons. The women likewise must be serious\, not slanderers\, but temperate\, faithful in all things. Let deacons be the husband of one wife\, and let them manage their children and their households well; for those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and also great confidence in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 10:17-27\nAt that time\, as Jesus was setting out on his journey\, a man ran up and knelt before him\, and asked him\, \"Good Teacher\, what must I do to inherit eternal life?\" And Jesus said to him\, \"Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. You know the commandments: 'Do not kill\, Do not commit adultery\, Do not steal\, Do not bear false witness\, Do not defraud\, Honor your father and mother.' \" And he said to him\, \"Teacher\, all these I have observed from my youth.\" And Jesus looking upon him loved him\, and said to him\, \"You lack one thing; go\, sell what you have\, and give to the poor\, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come\, follow me.\" At that saying his countenance fell\, and he went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions. And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples\, \"How hard it will be for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!\" And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again\, \"Children\, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\" And they were exceedingly astonished\, and said to him\, \"Then who can be saved?\" Jesus looked at them and said\, \"With men it is impossible\, but not with God; for all things are possible with God.\"\n\n

For you had compassion on the prisoners\, and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property\, since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one.  Therefore do not throw away your confidence\, which has a great reward.  For you have need of endurance\, so that you may do the will of God and receive what is promised.  \"For yet a little while\, and the coming one shall come and shall not tarry; but my righteous one shall live by faith.\"\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 9:33-41\nAt that time\, Jesus and his disciples came to Capernaum\, and when he was in the house he asked them\, \"What were you discussing on the way?\"  But they were silent; for on the way they had discussed with one another who was the greatest.

For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written\, \"Cursed be every one who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law\, and do them.\" Now it is evident that no man is justified before God by the law; for \"the righteous shall live by faith\"; but the law does not rest on faith\, for \"He who does them shall live by them.\"\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 13:19-29\nThe Lord said this parable\, \"The kingdom of God is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his garden; and it grew and became a tree\, and the birds of the air made nests in its branches.\" And again he said\, \"To what shall I compare the kingdom of God? It is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour\, till it was all leavened.\" He went on his way through towns and villages\, teaching\, and journeying toward Jerusalem. And some one said to him\, \"Lord\, will those who are saved be few?\" And he said to them\, \"Strive to enter by the narrow door; for many\, I tell you\, will seek to enter and will not be able. When once the householder has risen up and shut the door\, you will begin to stand outside and to knock at the door\, saying\, 'Lord\, open to us.' He will answer you\, 'I do not know where you come from.' Then you will begin to say\, 'We ate and drank in your presence\, and you taught in our streets.' But he will say\, 'I tell you\, I do not know where you come from; depart from me\, all you workers of iniquity!' There you will weep and gnash your teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God and you yourselves thrust out. And men will come from east and west\, and from north and south\, and sit at table in the kingdom of God.\"\n\n

And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb\, but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. While they were perplexed about this\, behold\, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel; and as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground\, the men said to them\, \"Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here\, but has risen. Remember how He told you\, while He was still in Galilee\, that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men\, and be crucified\, and on the third day rise.\" And they remembered His words and returning from the tomb they told all this to the eleven and to all the rest. Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told this to the Apostles; but these words seemed to them an idle tale\, and they did not believe them. But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in\, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home wondering at what had happened.\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 11:9-10; 32-40\nBRETHREN\, by faith Abraham sojourned in the land of promise\, as in a foreign land\, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob\, heirs with him of the same promise.  For he looked forward to the city which has foundation\, whose builder and maker is God.\n\nAnd what more shall I say?  For time would fail me to tell of Gideon\, Barak\, Samson\, Jephthah\, of David and Samuel and the prophets - who through faith conquered kingdoms\, enforced justice\, received promises\, stopped the mouths of lions\, quenched raging fire\, escaped the edge of the sword\, won strength out of weakness\, became mighty in war\, put foreign armies to flight.  Women received their dead by resurrection.  Some were tortured\, refusing to accept release\, that they might rise again to a better life.  Others suffered mocking and scourging\, and even chains and imprisonment.  They were stoned\, they were sawn in two\, they were tempted\, they were killed with the sword; they went about in skins of sheep and goats\, destitute\, afflicted\, ill-treated - of whom the world was not worthy - wandering over deserts and mountains\, and in dens and caves of the earth.\n\nAnd all these\, though well attested by their faith\, did not receive what was promised\, since God had foreseen something better for us\, that apart from us they should not be made perfect.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 1:1-25\nThe book of the Genealogy of Jesus Christ\, the son of David\, the son of Abraham.\n\nAbraham was the father of Isaac\, and Isaac the father of Jacob\, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers\, and Judah the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar\, and Perez the father of Hezron\, and Hezron the father of Aram\, and Aram the father of Amminadab\, and Amminadab the father of Nahshon\, and Nahshon the father of Salmon\, and Salmon the father of Boaz by Rahab\, and Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth\, and Obed the father of Jesse\, and Jesse the father of David the king.\n\nAnd David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah\, and Solomon the father of Rehoboam\, and Rehoboam the father of Abijah\, and Abijah the father of Asa\, and Asa the father of Jehoshaphat\, and Jehoshaphat the father of Joram\, and Joram the father of Uzziah\, and Uzziah the father of Jotham\, and Jotham the father of Ahaz\, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah\, and Hezekiah the father of Manasseh\, and Manasseh the father of Amon\, and Amon the father of Josiah\, and Josiah the father of Jechoniah and his brothers\, at the time of the deportation to Babylon.\n\nAnd after the deportation to Babylon: Jechoniah was the father of Salathiel\, and Salathiel the father of Zerubbabel\, and Zerubbabel the father of Abiud\, and Abiud the father of Eliakim\, and Eliakim the father of Azor\, and Azor the father of Zadok\, and Zadok the father of Achim\, and Achim the father of Eliud\, and Eliud the father of Eleazar\, and Eleazar the father of Matthan\, and Matthan the father of Jacob\, and Jacob the father of Joseph the husband of Mary\, of whom Jesus was born\, who is called Christ.\n\nSo all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations\, and from David to the deportation to Babylon fourteen generations\, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations.\n\nNow the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph\, before they came together she was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit; and her husband Joseph\, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame\, resolved to divorce her quietly. But as he considered this\, behold\, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream\, saying\, \"Joseph\, son of David\, do not fear to take Mary your wife\, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit; she will bear a son\, and you shall call his name Jesus\, for he will save his people from their sins.\" All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: \"Behold\, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son\, and his name shall be called Emmanuel\" (which means\, God with us). When Joseph woke from sleep\, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him; he took his wife\, but knew her not until she had borne a son; and he called his name Jesus.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 12/23/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Forefeast of the Nativity of Our Lord and Savior\, Jesus Christ; Ten Martyrs of Crete; Paul\, Archbishop of Neo-Caesarea; Rememberance of the Founding of the Holy and Great Church of Christ\, Hagia Sophia in Constantinople; Naoum the Illuminator of The Bulgarians; Nicholas & John the New Martyrs\n\nStrict Fast\n\nEpistle Reading: I Timothy 5:1-10\nTimothy\, my son\, do not rebuke an older man but exhort him as you would a father; treat younger men like brothers\, older women like mothers\, younger women like sisters\, in all purity. Honor widows who are real widows. If a widow has children or grandchildren\, let them first learn their religious duty to their own family and make some return to their parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God. She who is a real widow\, and is left all alone\, has set her hope on God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day; whereas she who is self-indulgent is dead even while she lives. Command this\, so that they may be without reproach. If any one does not provide for his relatives\, and especially for his own family\, he has disowned the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. Let a widow be enrolled if she is not less than sixty years of age\, having been the wife of one husband; and she must be well attested for her good deeds\, as one who has brought up children\, shown hospitality\, washed the feet of the saints\, relieved the afflicted\, and devoted herself to doing good in every way.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 10:46-52\nAt that time\, as Jesus was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great multitude\, Bartimaios\, a blind beggar\, the son of Timaios\, was sitting by the roadside. And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth\, he began to cry out and say\, \"Jesus\, Son of David\, have mercy on me!\" And many rebuked him\, telling him to be silent; but he cried out all the more\, \"Son of David\, have mercy on me!\" And Jesus stopped and said\, \"Call him.\" And they called the blind man\, saying to him\, \"Take heart; rise\, he is calling you.\" And throwing off his mantle he sprang up and came to Jesus. And Jesus said to him\, \"What do you want me to do for you?\" And the blind man said to him\, \"Rabbi\, let me receive my sight.\" And Jesus said to him\, \"Go your way; your faith has made you well.\" And immediately he received his sight and followed him on the way.\n\n

SUMMARY:Eve of the Nativity of Christ
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 12/24/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Eve of the Nativity of Christ; Eugenia the Righteous Nun-martyr of Rome and those with her\n\nStrict Fast\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 1:1-12\n IN MANY AND VARIOUS WAYS God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets; but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son\, whom he appointed the heir of all things\, through whom also he created the world. He reflects the glory of God and bears the very stamp of his nature\, upholding the universe by his word of power. When he had made purification for sins\, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high\, having become as much superior to angels as the name he has obtained is more excellent than theirs. For to what angel did God ever say\, \"Thou art my Son\, today I have begotten thee\"? Or again\, \"I will be to him a father\, and he shall be to me a son\"? And again\, when he brings the first-born into the world\, he says\, \"Let all God's angels worship him.\" Of the angels he says\, \"Who makes his angels winds\, and his servants flames of fire.\" But of the Son he says\, \"Thy throne\, O God\, is for ever and ever\, the righteous scepter is the scepter of thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore God\, thy God\, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness beyond thy comrades.\" And\, \"Thou\, Lord\, didst found the earth in the beginning\, and the heavens are the work of thy hands; they will perish\, but thou remainest; they will all grow old like a garment\, like a mantle thou wilt roll them up\, and they will be changed. But thou art the same\, and thy years will never end.\"\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 2:1-20\nIn those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled. This was the first enrollment\, when Quirinius was governor of Syria. And all went to be enrolled\, each to his own city. And Joseph also went up from Galilee\, from the city of Nazareth\, to Judea\, to the city of David\, which is called Bethlehem\, because he was of the house and lineage of David\, to be enrolled with Mary\, his betrothed\, who was with child. And while they were there\, the time came for her to be delivered. And she gave birth to her first born son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes\, and laid him in a manger\, because there was no place for them in the inn.\n\nAnd in that region there were shepherds out in the field\, keeping watch over their flock by night. And an angel of the Lord appeared to them\, and the glory of the Lord shone around them\, and they were filled with fear. And the angel said to them\, \"Be not afraid; for behold\, I bring you good news of a great joy which will come to all the people; for to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior\, who is Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign for you: you will find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.\" And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying\, \"Glory to God in the highest\, and on earth peace\, good will among men!\"\n\nWhen the angels went away from them into heaven\, the shepherds said to one another\, \"Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened\, which the Lord has made known to us.\" And they went with haste\, and found Mary and Joseph\, and the babe lying in a manger. And when they saw it they made known the saying which had been told them concerning this child; and all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them. But Mary kept all these things\, pondering them in her heart. And the shepherds returned\, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen\, as it had been told them.\n\n

When Joseph woke from sleep\, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him; he took his wife\, but knew her not until she had borne a son; and he called his name Jesus.\n\nEpistle Reading: Galatians 4:4-7\nBRETHREN\, when the time had fully come\, God sent forth his Son\, born of woman\, born under the law\, to redeem those who were under the law\, so that we might receive adoption as sons. And because you are sons\, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts\, crying\, \"Abba! Father!\" So you are no longer a slave but a son\, and if a son then also an heir of God through Christ. \n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 2:1-12\nWhen Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king\, behold\, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem\, saying\, \"Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the East\, and have come to worship him.\" When Herod the king heard this\, he was troubled\, and all Jerusalem with him; and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people\, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. They told him\, \"In Bethlehem of Judea; for so it is written by the prophet: 'And you\, O Bethlehem\, in the land of Judah\, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who will govern my people Israel.'\"\n\nThen Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star appeared; and he sent them to Bethlehem\, saying\, \"Go and search diligently for the child\, and when you have found him bring me word\, that I too may come and worship him.\" When they had heard the king they went their way; and lo the star which they had seen in the East went before them\, till it came to rest over the place where the child was. When they saw the star\, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy; and going into the house they saw the child with Mary his mother\, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then\, opening their treasures\, they offered him gifts\, gold and frankincense and myrrh. And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod\, they departed to their own country by another way.\n\n

That is why he is not ashamed to call them brethren\, saying\, \"I will proclaim thy name to my brethren\, in the midst of the congregation I will praise thee.\" And again\, \"I will put my trust in him.\" And again\, \"Here am I\, and the children God has given me. Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood\, he himself likewise partook of the same nature\, that through death he might destroy him who has the power of death\, that is\, the devil\, and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong bondage. For surely it is not with angels that he is concerned but with the descendants of Abraham. Therefore he had to be made like his brethren in every respect\, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God\, to make expiation for the sins of the people. For because he himself has suffered and been tempted\, he is able to help those who are tempted. \n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 2:13-23\nWhen the wise men departed\, behold\, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said\, \"Rise\, take the child and his mother\, and flee to Egypt\, and remain there till I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child\, to destroy him.\" And he rose and took the child and his mother by night\, and departed to Egypt\, and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet\, \"Out of Egypt have I called my son.\"\n\nThen Herod\, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men\, was in a furious rage\, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under\, according to the time which he had ascertained from the wise men.

But when he heard that Archelaos reigned over Judea in place of his father Herod\, he was afraid to go there\, and being warned in a dream he withdrew to the district of Galilee. And he went and dwelt in a city called Nazareth\, that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled\, \"He shall be called a Nazarene.\"\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 12/27/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Stephen\, Archdeacon & First Martyr; Afterfeast of the Nativity; Theodore the Confessor\, brother of Saint Theophanes the Poet; Theodore\, Patriarch of Constantinople\n\nFast Free\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 6:8-15;7:1-5\,47-60\nIn those days\, Stephen\, full of grace and power\, did great wonders and signs among the people. Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called)\, and of the Cyrenians\, and of the Alexandrians\, and of those from Cilicia and Asia\, arose and disputed with Stephen. But they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke. Then they secretly instigated men\, who said\, \"We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.\" And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes\, and they came upon him and seized him and brought him before the council\, and set up false witnesses who said\, \"This man never ceases to speak words against this holy place and the law; for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place\, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.\" And gazing at him\, all who sat in the council saw that his face was like the face of an angel.\n\nAnd the high priest said\, \"Is this so?\" And Stephen said: \"Brethren and fathers\, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham\, when he was in Mesopotamia\, before he lived in Haran\, and said to him\, 'Depart from your land and from your kindred and go into the land which I will show you.' Then he departed from the land of the Chaldeans\, and lived in Haran. And after his father died\, God removed him from there into this land in which you are now living; yet he gave him no inheritance in it\, not even a foot's length\, but promised to give it to him in possession and to his posterity after him\, though he had no child.\n\n\"But it was Solomon who built a house for him. Yet the Most High does not dwell in houses made with hands; as the prophet says\, 'Heaven is my throne\, and earth my footstool. What house will you build for me\, says the Lord\, or what is the place of my rest? Did not my hand make all these things?'\n\n\"You stiff-necked people\, uncircumcised in heart and ears\, you always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did\, so do you. Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One\, whom you have now betrayed and murdered\, you who received the law as delivered by angels and did not keep it.\"\n\nNow when they heard these things they were enraged\, and they ground their teeth against him. But he\, full of the Holy Spirit\, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God\, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God; and he said\, \"Behold\, I see the heavens opened\, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God.\" But they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and rushed together upon him. Then they cast him out of the city and stoned him; and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul. And as they were stoning Stephen\, he prayed\, \"Lord Jesus\, receive my spirit.\" And he knelt down and cried with a loud voice\, \"Lord\, do not hold this sin against them.\" And when he had said this\, he fell asleep.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 21:33-42\nThe Lord said this parable\, \"There was a householder who planted a vineyard\, and set a hedge around it\, and dug a wine press in it\, and built a tower\, and let it out to tenants\, and went into another country. When the season of fruit drew near\, he sent his servants to the tenants\, to get his fruit; and the tenants took his servants and beat one\, killed another\, and stoned another. Again he sent other servants\, more than the first; and they did the same to them. Afterward he sent his son to them\, saying 'They will respect my son.' But when the tenants saw the son\, they said to themselves\, 'This is the heir; come\, let us kill him and have his inheritance.' And they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. When therefore the owner of the vineyard comes\, what will he do to those tenants?\" They said to him\, \"He will put those wretches to a miserable death\, and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons.\" Jesus said to them\, \"Have you never read in the scriptures: 'The very stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner; this was the Lord's doing\, and it is marvelous in our eyes?'\"\n\n

That very day] two of them were going to a village named Emmaus\, about seven miles from Jerusalem\, and talking with each other about all these things that had happened. While they were talking and discussing together\, Jesus Himself drew near and went with them. But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him. And He said to them\, \"What is this conversation which you are holding with each other as you walk?\" and they stood still\, looking sad. Then one of them\, named Cleopas\, answered Him\, \"Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?\" And He said to them\, \"What things?\" And they said to him\, \"Concerning Jesus of Nazareth\, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people\, and how our chief priests and rulers delivered Him up to be condemned to death\, and crucified Him. But we had hoped that He was the one to redeem Israel. Yes\, and besides all this\, it is now the third day since this happened. Moreover\, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning and did not find His body; and they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels\, who said that He was alive. Some of those who were with us went to the tomb\, and found it just as the women had said; but Him they did not see.\" And He said to them\, \"O foolish men\, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Was not it necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into this glory?\" And beginning with Moses and all the prophets\, He interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning Himself. So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He appeared to be going further\, but they constrained Him\, saying\, \"Stay with us\, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.\" So He went in to stay with them. When He was at table with them\, He took the bread and blessed\, and broke it\, and gave it to them. And their eyes were opened and they recognized Him; and He vanished out of their sight. They said to each other\, \"Did not our hearts burn within us while He talked to us on the road\, while He opened to us the scriptures?\" And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven gathered together and those who were with them\, who said\, \"The Lord has risen indeed\, and has appeared to Simon!\" Then they told what had happened on the road and how He was known to them in the breaking of the bread.\n\nEpistle Reading: Galatians 1:11-19\nBrethren\, I would have you know that the gospel which was preached by me is not man's gospel. For I did not receive it from man\, nor was I taught it\, but it came through a revelation of Jesus Christ. For you have heard of my former life in Judaism\, how I persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it; and I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people\, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers. But when he who had set me apart before I was born\, and had called me through his grace\, was pleased to reveal his Son to me\, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles\, I did not confer with flesh and blood\, nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me\, but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned to Damascus. Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas\, and remained with him fifteen days. But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord's brother.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 2:13-23\nWhen the wise men departed\, behold\, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said\, \"Rise\, take the child and his mother\, and flee to Egypt\, and remain there till I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child\, to destroy him.\" And he rose and took the child and his mother by night\, and departed to Egypt\, and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet\, \"Out of Egypt have I called my son.\"\n\nThen Herod\, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men\, was in a furious rage\, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under\, according to the time which he had ascertained from the wise men. Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah: \"A voice was heard in Ramah\, wailing and loud lamentation\, Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be consoled\, because they were no more.\" But when Herod died\, behold\, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt\, saying\, \"Rise\, take the child and his mother\, and go to the land of Israel\, for those who sought the child's life are dead.\" And he rose and took the child and his mother\, and went to the land of Israel. But when he heard that Archelaos reigned over Judea in place of his father Herod\, he was afraid to go there\, and being warned in a dream he withdrew to the district of Galilee.

If any one purifies himself from what is ignoble\, then he will be a vessel for noble use\, consecrated and useful to the master of the house\, ready for any good work. So shun youthful passions and aim at righteousness\, faith\, love\, and peace\, along with those who call upon the Lord from a pure heart. Have nothing to do with stupid\, senseless controversies; you know that they breed quarrels. And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but kindly to every one\, an apt teacher\, forbearing\, correcting his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant that they will repent and come to know the truth\, and they may escape from the snare of the devil\, after being captured by him to do his will.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 12:13-17\nAt that time\, the chief priests and scribes sent to Jesus some of the Pharisees and some of the Herodians\, to entrap him in his talk. And they came and said to him\, \"Teacher\, we know that you are true\, and care for no man; for you do not regard the position of men\, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar\, or not? Should we pay them\, or should we not?\" But knowing their hypocrisy\, he said to them\, \"Why put me to the test? Bring me a coin\, and let me look at it.\" And they brought one. And he said to them\, \"Whose likeness and inscription is this?\" They said to him\, \"Caesar's.\" Jesus said to them\, \"Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's\, and to God the things that are God's.\" And they were amazed at him.\n\n

SUMMARY:Apodosis of the Nativity of Our Lord and Savior\, Jesus Christ
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 12/31/2024\n\nSaints and Feasts: Apodosis of the Nativity of Our Lord and Savior\, Jesus Christ; Melania the Younger\, Nun of Rome; The Martyr and Presbyter Zoticus of Rome\, Patron of Orphans\n\nFast Free\n\nEpistle Reading: II Timothy 3:16-17;4:1-4\nTimothy\, my son\, all scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching\, for reproof\, for correction\, and for training in righteousness\, that the man of God may be complete\, equipped for every good work.\n\nI charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus who is to judge the living and the dead\, and by his appearing and his kingdom: preach the word\, be urgent in season and out of season\, convince\, rebuke\, and exhort\, be unfailing in patience and in teaching. For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching\, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own likings\, and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander into myths.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 11:11-23\nAt that time\, Jesus entered Jerusalem\, and went into the temple; and when he had looked round at everything\, as it was already late\, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.\n\nOn the following day\, when they came from Bethany\, he was hungry. And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf\, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it\, he found nothing but leaves\, for it was not the season for figs. And he said to it\, \"May no one ever eat fruit from you again.\" And his disciples heard it.\n\nAnd they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold and those who bought in the temple\, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons; and he would not allow any one to carry anything through the temple. And he taught\, and said to them\, \"Is it not written\, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations'? But you have made it a den of robbers.\" And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and sought a way to destroy him; for they feared him\, because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching. And when evening came they went out of the city.\n\nAs they passed by in the morning\, they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots. And Peter remembered and said to him\, \"Rabbi\, look! The fig tree which you cursed has withered.\" And Jesus answered them\, \"Have faith in God. Truly\, I say to you\, whoever says to this mountain\, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea\,' and does not doubt in his heart\, but believes that what he says will come to pass\, it will be done for him.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Circumcision of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 01/01/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Circumcision of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ; Basil the Great\, Archbishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia; Emmelia\, Mother of Basil the Great\, Gregory of Nyssa\, Makrina\, and Peter of Sebaste; Gregory\, Bishop of Nanzianzos\, Father of Gregory the Theologian; Peter the New Martyr of the Peloponnesos; Theodotos the Martyr; Righteous Theodosios of Triglia; Telemachos the Martyr; Fulgentius\, Bishop of Ruspe\n\nFast Free\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: John 10:1-9\nThe Lord said to the Jews who had come to him\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way\, that man is a thief and a robber; but he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the gatekeeper opens; the sheep hear his voice\, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own\, he goes before them\, and the sheep follow him\, for they know his voice. A stranger they will not follow\, but they will flee from him\, for they do not know the voice of strangers.\" This figure Jesus used with them\, but they did not understand what he was saying to them. So Jesus again said to them\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, I am the door of the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not heed them. I am the door; if any one enters by me\, he will be saved\, and will go in and out and find pasture.\"\n\nEpistle Reading: Colossians 2:8-12\nBRETHREN\, see to it that no one makes a prey of you by philosophy and empty deceit\, according to human tradition\, according to the elemental spirits of the universe\, and not according to Christ. For in him the whole fulness of deity dwells bodily\, and you have come to fulness of life in him\, who is the head of all rule and authority. In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands\, by putting off the body of flesh in the circumcision of Christ; and you were buried with him in baptism\, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God\, who raised him from the dead.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 2:20-21\, 40-52\nAt that time\, the shepherds returned\, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen\, as it had been told them. And at the end of eight days\, when he was circumcised\, he was called Jesus\, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb. And the child grew and became strong\, filled with wisdom; and the favor of God was upon him. Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the Passover. And when he was twelve years old\, they went up according to custom; and when the feast was ended\, as they were returning\, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it\, but supposing him to be in the company they went a day's journey\, and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintances; and when they did not find him\, they returned to Jerusalem\, seeking him. After three days\, they found him in the temple\, sitting among the teachers\, listening to them and asking them questions; and all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. And when they saw him they were astonished; and his mother said to him\, \"Son\, why have you treated us so? Behold\, your father and I have been looking for you anxiously.\" And he said to them\, \"How is it that you sought me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house?\" And they did not understand the saying which he spoke to them. And he went down with them and came to Nazareth\, and was obedient to them; and his mother kept all these things in her heart. And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature\, and in favor with God and man.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 01/02/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Forefeast of the Theophany of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; Sylvester\, Pope of Rome; Cosmas\, Archbishop of Constantinople; Seraphim the Wonderworker of Sarov; Juliana the Righteous; Theagenes the Hieromartyr\, Bishop of Parios; Theopemptos; Theodota\, the Mother of the Holy Anargyroi; Righteous Mark the Deaf; Basil the Martyr of Ankyra; Sergios; Theopistos the Martyr; George the New Martyr of Georgia; Nilos the Sanctified; Sylvester of the Kiev Caves\n\nFast Free\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 5:4-10\nBRETHREN\, one does not take the honor upon himself\, but he is called by God\, just as Aaron was. So also Christ did not exalt himself to be made a high priest\, but was appointed by him who said to him\, \"Thou art my Son\, today I have begotten thee\"; as he says also in another place\, \"Thou art a priest for ever\, after the order of Melchizedek.\" In the days of his flesh\, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications\, with loud cries and tears\, to him who was able to save him from death\, and he was heard for his godly fear. Although he was a Son\, he learned obedience through what he suffered; and being made perfect he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him\, being designated by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek. \n\nGospel Reading: John 3:1-15\nAt that time\, there was a man of the Pharisees\, named Nikodemos\, a ruler of the Jews. This man came to Jesus by night and said to him\, \"Rabbi\, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that you do\, unless God is with him.\" Jesus answered him\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, unless one is born from above\, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\" Nikodemos said to him\, \"How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?\" Jesus answered\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, unless one is born of water and the Spirit\, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh\, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you\, 'You must be born from above.' The Spirit blows where it wills\, and you hear the sound of it\, and you do not know whence it comes or whither it goes; so it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.\" Nikodemos said to him\, \"How can this be?\" Jesus answered him\, \"Are you a teacher of Israel\, and yet you do not understand this? Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, we speak of what we know\, and bear witness to what we have seen; but you do not receive our testimony. If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe\, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things? No one has ascended into heaven but he who descended from heaven\, the Son of man who is in heaven. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness\, so must the Son of man be lifted up\, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.\"\n\n

And the believers from among the circumcised who came with Peter were amazed\, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles. For they heard them speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter declared\, \"Can any one forbid water for baptizing these people who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?\" And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain for some days. Now the apostles and the brethren who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. So when Peter went up to Jerusalem\, the circumcision party criticized him\, saying\, \"Why did you go to uncircumcised men and eat with them?\" But Peter began and explained to them in order: \"I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision\, something descending\, like a great sheet\, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came down to me. Looking at it closely I observed animals and beasts of prey and reptiles and birds of the air. And I heard a voice saying to me\, 'Rise\, Peter; kill and eat.' But I said\, 'No\, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.' But the voice answered a second time from heaven\, 'What God has cleansed you must not call common.' This happened three times\, and all was drawn up again into heaven.\"\n\nGospel Reading: John 1:18-28\nNo one has ever seen God; the only-begotten Son\, who is in the bosom of the Father\, he has made him known.\n\nAnd this is the testimony of John\, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him\, \"Who are you?\" He confessed\, he did not deny\, but confessed\, \"I am not the Christ.\" And they asked him\, \"What then? Are you Elijah?\" He said\, \"I am not.\" \"Are you the prophet?\" And he answered\, \"No.\" They said to him then\, \"Who are you? let us have an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\" He said\, \"I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness\, 'Make straight the way of the Lord\,' as the prophet Isaiah said.\"\n\nNow they had been sent from the Pharisees. They asked him\, \"Then why are you baptizing\, if you are neither the Christ\, nor Elijah\, nor the prophet?\" John answered them\, \"I baptize with water; but among you stands one whom you do not know\, even he who comes after me\, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.\" This took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan\, where John was baptizing.\n\n

I hope to come to you soon\, but I am writing these instructions to you so that\, if I am delayed\, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God\, which is the church of the living God\, the pillar and bulwark of the truth. Great indeed\, we confess\, is the mystery of our religion:\n\nGod was manifested in the flesh\, \njustified in the Spirit\, \nseen by angels\, \npreached among the nations\, \nbelieved on in the world\, \ntaken up in glory.\n\nNow the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by giving heed to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons\, through the pretensions of liars whose consciences are seared\, who forbid marriage and enjoin abstinence from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth. For everything created by God is good\, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving; for then it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 3:1-6\nAt that time\, John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea\, \"Repent\, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\" For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said\, \"The voice of one crying in the wilderness: prepare the way of the Lord\, make his paths straight.\" Now John wore a garment of camel's hair\, and a leather girdle around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey. Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan\, and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan\, confessing their sins.\n\n

And He said to them\, \"Why are you troubled\, and why do questionings rise in your hearts? See My hands and My feet\, that it is I Myself; handle Me\, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that I have.\" And when He had said this\, He showed them His hands and His feet. And while they still disbelieved for joy\, and wondered\, He said to them\, \"Have you anything here to eat?\" They gave Him a piece of broiled fish [and some honeycomb]\, and He took it and ate before them. Then He said to them\, \"These are My words which I spoke to you\, while I was still with you\, that everything written about Me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled.\" Then He opened their minds to understand the scriptures\, and said to them\, \"Thus it is written\, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead\, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in His name in all nations\, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. And behold\, I send the promise of My Father upon you; but stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.\" Then He led them out as far as Bethany\, and lifting up His hands\, He blessed them. While He blessed them\, He parted from them\, and was carried up into heaven. And they worshiped Him\, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy\, and were continually in the Temple blessing God.\n\nEpistle Reading: II Timothy 4:5-8\nTIMOTHY\, my son\, always be steady\, endure suffering\, do the work of an evangelist\, fulfil your ministry.\n\nFor I am already on the point of being sacrificed; the time of my departure has come.  I have fought the good fight\, I have finished the race\, I have kept the faith.  Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness\, which the Lord\, the righteous judge\, will award to me on that Day\, and not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 1:1-8\nThe beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ\, the Son of God. As it is written in the prophets\, 'Behold\, I send my messenger before your face\, who shall prepare your way; the voice of one crying in the wilderness: prepare the way of the Lord\, make his paths straight.' John was baptizing in the wilderness\, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. And there went out to him all the country of Judea\, and all the people of Jerusalem; and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan\, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel's hair\, and had a leather girdle around his waist\, and ate locusts and wild honey. And he preached\, saying\, \"After me comes he who is mightier than I\, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. I have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.\"\n\n

And when he came up out of the water\, immediately he saw the heavens opened and the Spirit descending upon him like a dove; and a voice came from heaven\, \"You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.\"\n\nEpistle Reading: Titus 2:11-14;3:4-7\nTITUS\, my son\, the grace of God has appeared for the salvation of all men\, training us to renounce irreligion and worldly passions\, and to live sober\, upright\, and godly lives in this world\, awaiting our blessed hope\, the appearing of the glory of the great God and Savior Jesus Christ\, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all iniquity and to purify for himself a people of his own who are zealous for good deeds.\n\nBut when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared\, he saved us\, not because of deeds done by us in righteousness\, but in virtue of his own mercy\, by the washing of regeneration and renewal in the Holy Spirit\, which he poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior\, so that we might be justified by his grace and become heirs in hope of eternal life.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 3:13-17\nAt that time\, Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John\, to be baptized by him. John would have prevented him\, saying\, \"I need to be baptized by you\, and do you come to me?\" But Jesus answered him\, \"Let it be so now; for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.\" Then he consented. And when Jesus was baptized\, he went up immediately from the water\, and behold\, the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove\, and alighting on him; and lo\, a voice from heaven\, saying\, \"This is my beloved Son\, with whom I am well pleased.\"\n\n

There he found some disciples. And he said to them\, \"Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?\" And they said\, \"No\, we have never even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.\" And he said\, \"Into what then were you baptized?\" They said\, \"Into John's baptism.\" And Paul said\, \"John baptized with the baptism of repentance\, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him\, that is\, Jesus.\" On hearing this\, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid his hands upon them\, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spoke with tongues and prophesied. There were about twelve of them in all. And he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly\, arguing and pleading about the kingdom of God.\n\nGospel Reading: John 1:29-34\nAt that time\, John saw Jesus coming toward him\, and said\, \"Behold\, the Lamb of God\, who takes away the sin of the world! This is he of whom I said\, 'After me comes a man who ranks before me\, for he was before me.' I myself did not know him; but for this I came baptizing with water\, that he might be revealed to Israel.\" And John bore witness\, \"I saw the Spirit descend as a dove from heaven\, and it remained on him. I myself did not know him; but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me\, 'He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain\, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.' And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.\"\n\n

We were buried therefore with Him by baptism into death\, so that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father\, we too might walk in newness of life.  For if we have been united with Him in a death like His\, we shall certainly be united with Him in a resurrection like His.  We know that our old self was crucified with Him so that the sinful body might be destroyed\, and we might no longer be enslaved to sin.  For he who has died is freed from sin.  But if we have died with Christ\, we believe that we shall also live with Him.  For we know that Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; death no longer has dominion over Him.  The death He died He died to sin\, once for all\, but the life He lives He lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\nGospel Reading: John 3:22-33\nAt that time\, Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judea; there He remained with them and baptized.  John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim\, because there was much water there; and people came and were baptized.  For John had not yet been put in prison.\n\nNow a discussion arose between John's disciples and a Jew over purifying.  And they came to John\, and said to him\, \"Rabbi\, he who was with you beyond the Jordan\, to whom you bore witness\, here he is\, baptizing\, and all are going to him.\"  John answered\, \"No one can receive anything except what is given him from heaven.  You yourselves bear me witness\, that I said\, I am not the Christ\, but I have been sent before Him.  He who has the bride is the bridegroom; the friend of the bridegroom\, who stands and hears him\, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice; therefore this joy of mine is now full.  He must increase\, but I must decrease.\n\n\"He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth belongs to the earth\, and of the earth he speaks; he who comes from heaven is above all.  He bears witness to what he has seen and heard\, yet no one receives his testimony; he who receives his testimony sets his seal to this\, that God is true.\"\n\n

Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. No soldier on service gets entangled in civilian pursuits\, since his aim is to satisfy the one who enlisted him. An athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. It is the hardworking farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops. Think over what I say\, for the Lord will grant you understanding in everything.\n\nRemember Jesus Christ\, risen from the dead\, descended from David\, as preached in my gospel\, the gospel for which I am suffering and wearing fetters like a criminal. But the word of God is not fettered. Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect\, that they also may obtain salvation in Christ Jesus with its eternal glory.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 1:9-15\nIn those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.

Therefore it is said\, \"When he ascended on high he led a host of captives\, and he gave gifts to men.\" (in saying\, \"He ascended\,\" what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower parts of the earth? He who descended is he who also ascended far above all the heavens\, that he might fill all things.) And his gifts were that some should be apostles\, some prophets\, some evangelists\, some pastors and teachers\, to equip the saints for the work of ministry\, for building up the body of Christ\, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God\, to mature manhood\, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 3:19-22\nAt that time\, Herod the tetrarch\, who had been reproved by John for Herodias\, his brother's wife\, and for all the evil things that Herod had done\, added this to them all\, that he shut up John in prison. Now when all the people were baptized\, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying\, the heaven was opened\, and the Holy Spirit descended upon him in bodily form\, as a dove\, and a voice came from heaven\, \"You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Afterfeast of the Theophany of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 01/11/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Afterfeast of the Theophany of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; Our Righteous Father Theodosius the Cenobiarch; Nikephoros the New Martyr of Crete; Vitalis of Gaza\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Luke 6:17-23\nAt that time\, Jesus stood on a level place\, with a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon\, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured.  And all the crowd sought to touch him\, for power came forth from him and healed them all.  And he lifted up his eyes on His disciples\, and said: \"Blessed are you poor\, for yours is the Kingdom of God.  Blessed are you that hunger now\, for you shall be satisfied.  Blessed are you that weep now\, for you shall laugh.  Blessed are you when men hate you\, and when they exclude you and revile you\, and cast out your name as evil\, on account of the Son of man!  Rejoice in that day\, and leap for joy\, for behold\, your reward is great in heaven.\"\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 13:7-16\nBrethren\, remember your leaders\, those who spoke to you the word of God; consider the outcome of their lives\, and imitate their faith.  Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and for ever.  Do not be led away by diverse and strange teachings; for it is well that the heart be strengthened by grace\, not by foods\, which have not benefited their adherents.  We have an altar from which those who serve the tent have no right to eat.  For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned outside the camp.  So Jesus also suffered outside the gate in order to sanctify the people through his own blood.  Therefore let us go forth to him outside the camp and bear the abuse he endured.  For here we have no lasting city\, but we seek the city which is to come.  Through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God\, that is\, the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name.  Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have\, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God. \n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 4:1-11\nAt that time\, Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.  And he fasted forty days and forty nights\, and afterward he was hungry.  And the tempter came and said to him\, \"If you are the Son of God\, command these stones to become loaves of bread.\"  But he answered\, \"It is written\, 'Man shall not live by bread alone\, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'\"  Then the devil took him to the holy city\, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple\, and said to him\, \"If you are the Son of God\, throw yourself down; for it is written\, 'He will give his angels charge of you\,' and 'On their hands they will bear you up\, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'\"  Jesus said to him\, \"Again\, it is written\, 'You shall not tempt the Lord your God.'\"  Again\, the devil took him to a very high mountain\, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them; and he said to him\, \"All these I will give you\, if you will fall down and worship me.\"  Then Jesus said to him\, \"Be gone\, Satan! for it is written\, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'\"  Then the devil left him\, and behold\, angels came and ministered to him.\n\n

SUMMARY:Sunday after Epiphany
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 01/12/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Sunday after Epiphany; Afterfeast of the Theophany of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; Tatiana the Martyr of Rome; Basil and John the Hieromartyrs; Martyr Mertios; Euthasia the Virgin-Martyr; Peter of Absalom; Benedict\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: John 20:1-10\nOn the first day of the week\, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early\, while it was still dark\, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb. So she ran\, and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple\, the one whom Jesus loved\, and said to them\, \"They have taken the Lord out of the tomb\, and we do not know where they have laid Him.\" Peter then came out with the other disciple\, and they went toward the tomb. They both ran\, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first; and stooping to look in\, he saw the linen cloths lying there\, but he did not go in. Then Simon Peter came\, following him\, and went into the tomb; he saw the linen cloths lying and the napkin\, which had been on His head\, not lying with the linen cloths\, but rolled up in a place by itself. Then the other disciple\, who reached the tomb first\, also went in\, and he saw and believed; for as yet they did not know the scripture\, that He must rise from the dead. Then the disciples went back to their homes.\n\nEpistle Reading: Ephesians 4:7-13\nBRETHREN\, grace was given to each of us according to the measure of Christ's gift. Therefore it is said\, \"When he ascended on high he led a host of captives\, and he gave gifts to men.\" (in saying\, \"He ascended\,\" what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower parts of the earth? He who descended is he who also ascended far above all the heavens\, that he might fill all things.) And his gifts were that some should be apostles\, some prophets\, some evangelists\, some pastors and teachers\, to equip the saints for the work of ministry\, for building up the body of Christ\, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God\, to mature manhood\, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 4:12-17\nAt that time\, when Jesus heard that John had been arrested\, he withdrew into Galilee; and leaving Nazareth he went and dwelt in Capernaum by the sea\, in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali\, that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: \"The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali\, toward the sea\, across the Jordan\, Galilee of the Gentiles\, the people who sat in darkness have seen a great light\, and for those who sat in the region and shadow of death light has dawned.\"  From that time Jesus began to preach\, saying\, \"Repent\, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Afterfeast of the Theophany of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 01/13/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Afterfeast of the Theophany of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; The Holy Martyrs Hermylus and Stratonicus; Synaxis of the Most Holy Theotokos - Mediatress; Maximos the Righteous of Kapsokalyvia\, Mount Athos; Hilary of Poitiers; Kentigern\, Bishop of Glasgow\n\nEpistle Reading: Galatians 3:23-29;4:1-5\nBrethren\, before faith came\, we were confined under the law\, kept under restraint until faith should be revealed. So that the law was our custodian until Christ came\, that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come\, we are no longer under a custodian; for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God\, through faith. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek\, there is neither slave nor free\, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you are Christ's\, then you are Abraham's offspring\, heirs according to promise. I mean that the heir\, as long as he is a child\, is no better than a slave\, though he is the owner of all the estate; but he is under guardians and trustees until the date set by the father. So with us; when we were children\, we were slaves to the elemental spirits of the universe. But when the time had fully come\, God sent forth his Son\, born of a woman\, born under the law\, to redeem those who were under the law\, so that we might receive adoption as sons.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 20:1-8\nAt that time\, as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel\, the chief priests and the scribes with the elders came up and said to Him\, \"Tell us by what authority you do these things\, or who it is that gave you this authority.\"  He answered them\, \"I also will ask you a question; now tell me\, was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?\"  And they discussed it with one another\, saying\, \"If we say\, 'From heaven\,' he will say\, 'Why did you not believe him?'  But if we say\, 'From men\,' all the people will stone us; for they are convinced that John was a prophet.\"  So they answered that they did not know whence it was.  And Jesus said to them\, \"Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Leavetaking of the Theophany of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 01/14/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Leavetaking of the Theophany of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; The Holy Fathers slain at Sinai and Raitho; Plato the Hieromartyr\, Bishop of Tallini and all Estonia\, and the Priest Martyrs Michael and Nicholas; Agnes the Virgin-martyr; Sabbas (Sava)\, Archbishop of Serbia; Nina of Georgia\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 2:38-43\nIn those days\, Peter said to the people\, \"Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is to you and to your children and to all that are far off\, every one whom the Lord our God calls to him.\" And he testified with many other words and exhorted them\, saying\, \"Save yourselves from this crooked generation.\" So those who received his word were baptized\, and there were added that day about three thousand souls. And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship\, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. And fear came upon every soul; and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 4:1-15\nAt that time Jesus returned from the Jordan\, and was led by the Spirit for forty days in the wilderness\, tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing in those days; and when they were ended\, he was hungry. The devil said to him\, \"If you are the Son of God\, command this stone to become bread.\" And Jesus answered him\, \"It is written\, 'Man shall not live by bread alone.'\" And the devil took him up\, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time\, and said to him\, \"To you I will give all this authority and their glory; for it has been delivered to me\, and I will give it to whom I will. If you\, then\, will worship me\, it shall all be yours.\" And Jesus answered him\, \"It is written\, 'You shall worship the Lord your God\, and him only shall you serve.'\"\n\nAnd he took him to Jerusalem\, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple\, and said to him\, \"If you are the Son of God\, throw yourself down from here; for it is written\, 'He will give his angels charge of you\, to guard you\,' and 'On their hands they will bear you up\, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'\" And Jesus answered him\, \"It is said\, 'You shall not tempt the Lord your God.'\" And when the devil had ended every temptation\, he departed from him until an opportune time. And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee\, and a report concerning him went out through all the surrounding country. And he taught in their synagogues\, being glorified by all.\n\n

SUMMARY:Paul of Thebes
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 01/15/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Paul of Thebes; John the Hut-Dweller; Pansophios the Martyr of Alexandria\n\nStrict Fast\n\nEpistle Reading: Galatians 5:22-26;6:1-2\nBrethren\, the fruit of the Spirit is love\, joy\, peace\, patience\, kindness\, goodness\, faithfulness\, gentleness\, self-control; against such there is no law.  And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.  If we live by the Spirit\, let us also walk by the Spirit.  Let us have no self-conceit\, no provoking of one another\, no envy of one another.  Brethren\, if a man is overtaken in any trespass\, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness.  Look to yourself\, lest you too be tempted.  Bear one another's burdens\, and so fulfill the law of Christ.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 12:32-40\nThe Lord said\, \"Fear not\, little flock\, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.  Sell your possessions\, and give alms; provide yourselves with purses that do not grow old\, with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail\, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys.  For where your treasure is\, there will your heart be also.  Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning\, and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the marriage feast\, so that they may open to him at once when he comes and knocks.  Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes; truly\, I say to you\, he will gird himself and have them sit at table\, and he will come and serve them.  If he comes in the second watch\, or in the third\, and finds them so\, blessed are those servants!  But know this\, that if the householder had known at what hour the thief was coming\, he would not have left his house to be broken into.  You also must be ready; for the Son of man is coming at an unexpected hour.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Veneration of Apostle Peter's Precious Chains
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 01/16/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Veneration of Apostle Peter's Precious Chains; Righteous Hierodeacon Makarios of Kalogeras; Romilo the Monk of Mount Athos; Nicholas the New-Martyr of Mytilene; Peusippos\, Elasippos\, and Mesippos the siblings\, and their grandmother Neonilla\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 12:1-11\nAbout that time\, Herod the king laid violent hands upon some who belonged to the church. He killed James the brother of John with the sword; and when he saw that it pleased the Jews\, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the days of Unleavened Bread. And when he had seized him\, he put him in prison\, and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to guard him\, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people. So Peter was kept in prison; but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the Church.\n\nThe very night when Herod was about to bring him out\, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers\, bound with two chains\, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison; and behold\, an angel of the Lord appeared\, and a light shone in the cell; and he struck Peter on the side and woke him\, saying\, \"Get up quickly.\" And the chains fell off his hands. And the angel said to him\, \"Wrap your mantle around you and follow me.\" And he went out and followed him; he did not know that what was done by the angel was real\, but thought he was seeing a vision. When they had passed the first and the second guard\, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. It opened to them of its own accord\, and they went out and passed on through one street; and immediately the angel left him. And Peter came to himself\, and said\, \"Now I am sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.\"\n\nGospel Reading: John 21:14-25\nAt that time\, Jesus revealed himself to the disciples after he was raised from the dead. And he said to Simon Peter\, \"Simon\, son of John\, do you love me more than these?\" He said to him\, \"Yes\, Lord; you know that I love you.\" He said to him\, \"Feed my lambs.\" A second time he said to him\, \"Simon\, son of John\, do you love me?\" He said to him\, \"Yes\, Lord; you know that I love you.\" He said to him\, \"Tend my sheep.\" He said to him the third time\, \"Simon\, son of John\, do you love me?\" Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time\, \"Do you love me?\" And he said to him\, \"Lord\, you know everything; you know that I love you.\" Jesus said to him\, \"Feed my sheep. Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, when you were young\, you girded yourself and walked where you would; but when you are old\, you will stretch out your hands\, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go.\" (This he said to show by what death he was to glorify God.) And after this he said to him\, \"Follow me.\" Peter turned and saw following them the disciple whom Jesus loved\, who had lain close to his breast at the supper and had said\, \"Lord\, who is it that is going to betray you?\" When Peter saw him\, he said to Jesus\, \"Lord\, what about this man?\" Jesus said to him\, \"If it is my will that he remain until I come\, what is that to you? Follow me!\" The saying spread abroad among the brethren that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die\, but\, \"If it is my will that he remain until I come\, what is that to you?\" This is the disciple who is bearing witness to these things\, and who has written these things; and we know that his testimony is true. But there are also many other things which Jesus did; were every one of them to be written\, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen.\n\n

Come to me\, all who labor and are heavy laden\, and I will give you rest.  Take my yoke upon you\, and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart\, and you will find rest for your souls.  For my yoke is easy\, and my burden is light.\"\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 13:17-21\nBrethren\, obey your leaders and submit to them; for they are keeping watch over your souls\, as men who will have to give account.  Let them do this joyfully\, and not sadly\, for that would be of no advantage to you.  Pray for us\, for we are sure that we have a clear conscience\, desiring to act honorably in all things.  I urge you the more earnestly to do this in order that I may be restored to you the sooner.  Now may the God of peace who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus\, the great Shepherd of the sheep\, by the blood of the eternal covenant\, equip you with everything good that you may do His will\, working in you that which is pleasing in His sight\, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever.  Amen. \n\nGospel Reading: Luke 6:17-23\nAt that time\, Jesus stood on a level place\, with a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon\, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured.

Rejoice in that day\, and leap for joy\, for behold\, your reward is great in heaven.\"\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 01/18/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Athanasios and Cyril\, Patriarchs of Alexandria; Zenia the Martyr\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: John 10:1-9\nThe Lord said to the Jews who had come to him\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way\, that man is a thief and a robber; but he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the gatekeeper opens; the sheep hear his voice\, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own\, he goes before them\, and the sheep follow him\, for they know his voice. A stranger they will not follow\, but they will flee from him\, for they do not know the voice of strangers.\" This figure Jesus used with them\, but they did not understand what he was saying to them. So Jesus again said to them\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, I am the door of the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not heed them. I am the door; if any one enters by me\, he will be saved\, and will go in and out and find pasture.\"\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 13:7-16\nBrethren\, remember your leaders\, those who spoke to you the word of God; consider the outcome of their lives\, and imitate their faith.  Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and for ever.  Do not be led away by diverse and strange teachings; for it is well that the heart be strengthened by grace\, not by foods\, which have not benefited their adherents.

A city set on a hill cannot be hid.  Nor do men light a lamp and put it under a bushel\, but on a stand\, and it gives light to all in the house.  Let your light so shine before men\, that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.  Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfill them.  For truly\, I say to you\, till heaven and earth pass away\, not an iota\, not a dot\, will pass from the law until all is accomplished.  Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so\, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\"\n\n

They said to her\, \"Woman\, why are you weeping?\" She said to them\, \"Because they have taken away my Lord\, and I do not know where they have laid Him.\" Saying this\, she turned round and saw Jesus standing\, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her\, \"Woman\, why are you weeping? Whom do you seek?\" Supposing Him to be the gardener\, she said to Him\, \"Sir\, if you have carried Him away\, tell me where you have laid Him\, and I will take Him away.\" Jesus said to her\, \"Mary.\" She turned and said to Him in Hebrew\, \"Rabboni\,\" which means Teacher. Jesus said to her\, \"Do not touch Me\, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brethren and say to them\, I am ascending to My Father and your Father\, to My God and your God.\" Mary Magdalene went and said to the disciples\, \"I have seen the Lord\,\" and she told them that He had said these things to her.\n\nEpistle Reading: Colossians 3:4-11\nBrethren\, when Christ who is our life appears\, then you also will appear with him in glory. Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: fornication\, impurity\, passion\, evil desire\, and covetousness\, which is idolatry. On account of these the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience. In these you once walked\, when you lived in them. But now put them all away: anger\, wrath\, malice\, slander\, and foul talk from your mouth. Do not lie to one another\, seeing that you have put off the old nature with its practices and have put on the new nature\, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator. Here there cannot be Greek and Jew\, circumcised and uncircumcised\, barbarian\, Scythian\, slave\, free man\, but Christ is all\, and in all.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 17:12-19\nAt that time\, as Jesus entered a village\, he was met by ten lepers\, who stood at a distance and lifted up their voices and said:  \"Jesus\, Master\, have mercy on us.\"  When he saw them he said to them\, \"Go and show yourselves to the priests.\" And as they went they were cleansed.  Then one of them\, when he saw that he was healed\, turned back\, praising God with a loud voice; and he fell on his face at Jesus's feet\, giving him thanks.  Now he was a Samaritan.  Then said Jesus: \"Were not ten cleansed? Where are the nine?  Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?\" And he said to him: \"Rise and go your way; your faith has made you well.\"\n\n

We are afflicted in every way\, but not crushed; perplexed\, but not driven to despair; persecuted\, but not forsaken; struck down\, but not destroyed; always carrying in the body the death of Jesus\, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies.  For while we live we are always being given up to death for Jesus' sake\, so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.  So death is at work in us\, but life in you.\n\nSince we have the same spirit of faith as he had who wrote\, \"I believed\, and so I spoke\,\" we too believe\, and so we speak\, knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence.  For it is all for your sake\, so that as grace extends to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving\, to the glory of God.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 6:17-23\nAt that time\, Jesus stood on a level place\, with a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon\, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured.

And he lifted up his eyes on His disciples\, and said: \"Blessed are you poor\, for yours is the Kingdom of God.  Blessed are you that hunger now\, for you shall be satisfied.  Blessed are you that weep now\, for you shall laugh.  Blessed are you when men hate you\, and when they exclude you and revile you\, and cast out your name as evil\, on account of the Son of man!  Rejoice in that day\, and leap for joy\, for behold\, your reward is great in heaven.\"\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 01/21/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Maximus the Confessor; Martyrs Neophytos\, Agnes\, Patroclus\, Maximus the Greek and Eugene of Trebizond; Neophytos the Martyr of Nicaea\n\nEpistle Reading: Philippians 1:12-20\nBrethren\, I want you to know that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel\, so that it has become known throughout the praetorian guard and to all the rest that my imprisonment is for Christ; and most of the brethren have been made confident in the Lord because of my imprisonment\, and are much more bold to speak the word of God without fear.  Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry\, but others from good will.  The latter do it out of love\, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel; the former proclaim Christ out of partisanship\, not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment.  What then?  Only that in every way\, whether in pretense or in truth\, Christ is proclaimed; and in that I rejoice.  Yes\, and I shall rejoice.  For I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance\, as it is my eager expectation and hope. \n\nGospel Reading: Luke 12:8-12\nThe Lord said to His disciples\, \"Every one who acknowledges me before men\, the Son of Man also will acknowledge before the angels of God; but he who denies me before men will be denied before the angels of God.  And every one who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.  And when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities\, do not be anxious how or what you are to answer or what you are to say; for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say.\"\n\n

As I remember your tears\, I long night and day to see you\, that I may be filled with joy.  I am reminded of your sincere faith\, a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now\, I am sure\, dwells in you.  Hence I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands; for God did not give us a spirit of timidity but a spirit of power and love and self-control.\n\nDo not be ashamed then of testifying to our Lord\, nor of me his prisoner\, but share in suffering for the gospel in the power of God.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 10:32-33; 37-38; 19:27-30\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"Every one who acknowledges me before men\, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven; but whoever denies me before men\, I also will deny him before my Father who is in heaven.  He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; and he who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.\"  Then Peter said in reply\, \"Lo\, we have left everything and followed you.  What then shall we have?\"  Jesus said to them\, \"Truly\, I say to you\, in the new world\, when the Son of man shall sit on his glorious throne\, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones\, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.  And every one who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands\, for my name's sake\, will receive a hundredfold\, and inherit eternal life.  But many that are first will be last\, and the last first.\"\n\n

Therefore\, my brethren\, whom I love and long for\, my joy and crown\, stand firm thus in the Lord\, my beloved.  I entreat Euodia and I entreat Syntyche to agree in the Lord.  And I ask you also\, true yokefellow\, help these women\, for they have labored side by side with me in the gospel together with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers\, whose names are in the book of life. \n\nGospel Reading: Mark 2:23-28; 3:1-5\nAt that time\, Jesus was going through the grainfields; and as they made their way his disciples began to pluck heads of grain.  And the Pharisees said to him\, \"Look\, why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?\"  And he said to them\, \"Have you never read what David did\, when he was in need and was hungry\, he and those who were with him: how he entered the house of God\, when Abiathar was high priest\, and ate the bread of the Presence\, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat\, and also gave it to those who were with him?\"  And he said to them\, \"The sabbath was made for man\, not man for the sabbath; so the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath.\"\n\nAgain he entered the synagogue\, and a man was there who had a withered hand.  And they watched him\, to see whether he would heal him on the sabbath\, so that they might accuse him.  And he said to the man who had the withered hand\, \"Come here.\"  And he said to them\, \"Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do harm\, to save life or to kill?\"  But they were silent.  And he looked around at them with anger\, grieved at their hardness of heart\, and said to the man\, \"Stretch it out\,\" and his hand was restored.\n\n

SUMMARY:Xenia\, Deaconess of Rome
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 01/24/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Xenia\, Deaconess of Rome; Vavylas the Holy Martyr; Xenia of St. Petersburg\, Fool-for-Christ; Philo the Wonderworker\, Bishop of Karpasia in Cyprus\n\nStrict Fast\n\nEpistle Reading: Galatians 5:22-26;6:1-2\nBrethren\, the fruit of the Spirit is love\, joy\, peace\, patience\, kindness\, goodness\, faithfulness\, gentleness\, self-control; against such there is no law.  And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.  If we live by the Spirit\, let us also walk by the Spirit.  Let us have no self-conceit\, no provoking of one another\, no envy of one another.  Brethren\, if a man is overtaken in any trespass\, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness.  Look to yourself\, lest you too be tempted.  Bear one another's burdens\, and so fulfill the law of Christ.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 6:22-33\nThe Lord said\, \"The eye is the lamp of the body. So\, if your eye is sound\, your whole body will be full of light; but if your eye is not sound\, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness\, how great is the darkness! No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other\, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon. Therefore I tell you\, do not be anxious about your life\, what you shall eat or what you shall drink\, nor about your body\, what you shall put on. Is not life more than food\, and the body more than clothing? Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns\, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his span of life? And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field\, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you\, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field\, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven\, will he not much more clothe you\, O men of little faith? Therefore do not be anxious\, saying\, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear? For the Gentiles seek all these things; and your heavenly Father knows you need them all. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness\, and all these things shall be yours as well.\"\n\n

To him the gatekeeper opens; the sheep hear his voice\, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own\, he goes before them\, and the sheep follow him\, for they know his voice. A stranger they will not follow\, but they will flee from him\, for they do not know the voice of strangers.\" This figure Jesus used with them\, but they did not understand what he was saying to them. So Jesus again said to them\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, I am the door of the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not heed them. I am the door; if any one enters by me\, he will be saved\, and will go in and out and find pasture.\"\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 7:26-28;8:1-2\nBrethren\, it was fitting that we should have such a high priest\, holy\, blameless\, unstained\, separated from sinners\, exalted above the heavens.  He has no need\, like those high priests\, to offer sacrifices daily\, first for his own sins and then for those of the people; he did this once for all when he offered up himself.  Indeed\, the law appoints men in their weakness as high priests\, but the word of the oath\, which came later than the law\, appoints a Son who has been made perfect for ever.  Now the point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest\, one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven\, a minister in the sanctuary and the true tent which is set up not by man but by the Lord. \n\nGospel Reading: John 10:9-16\nThe Lord said\, \"I am the door; if any one enters by me\, he will be saved\, and will go in and out and find pasture.  The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came that they may have life\, and have it abundantly.  I am the good shepherd.  The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.  He who is a hireling and not a shepherd\, whose own the sheep are not\, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.  He flees because he is a hireling and cares nothing for the sheep.  I am the good shepherd; I know my own and my own know me\, as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.  And I have other sheep\, that are not of this fold; I must bring them also\, and they will heed my voice. So there shall be one flock\, one shepherd.\"\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 01/26/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: 15th Sunday of Luke; Xenophon & his Companions; Symeon the Elder of Mount Sinai\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: John 20:19-31\nOn the evening of that day\, the first day of the week\, the doors being shut where the disciples were for fear of the Jews\, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them\, \"Peace be with you.\" When He had said this\, He showed them His hands and His side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again\, \"Peace be with you. As the Father has sent Me\, even so I send you.\" And when He had said this\, He breathed on them and said to them\, \"Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any\, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any\, they are retained.\" Now Thomas\, one of the twelve\, called the Twin\, was not with them when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him\, \"We have seen the Lord.\" But he said to them\, \"Unless I see in His hands the print of the nails\, and place my finger in the mark of the nails\, and place my hand in His side\, I will not believe.\" Eight days later\, His disciples were again in the house\, and Thomas was with them. The doors were shut\, but Jesus came and stood among them and said\, \"Peace be with you.\" Then He said to Thomas\, \"Put your finger here\, and see My hands; and put out your hand\, and place it in My side; do not be faithless\, but believing.\" Thomas answered Him\, \"My Lord and My God!\" Jesus said to him\, \"Have you believed because you have seen Me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe.\" Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples\, which are not written in this book; but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ\, the Son of God\, and that believing\, you may have life in His name.\n\nEpistle Reading: I Timothy 4:9-15\nTimothy\, my son\, the saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance. For to this end we toil and suffer reproach\, because we have our hope set on the living God\, who is the Savior of all men\, especially of those who believe. Command and teach these things. Let no one despise your youth\, but set the believers an example in speech and conduct\, in love\, in faith\, in purity. Till I come\, attend to the public reading of scripture\, to preaching\, to teaching. Do not neglect the gift you have\, which was given you by prophetic utterance when the council of elders laid their hands upon you. Practice these duties\, devote yourself to them\, so that all may see your progress.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 19:1-10\nAt that time\, Jesus was passing through Jericho. And there was a man named Zacchaios; he was a chief collector\, and rich. And he sought to see who Jesus was\, but could not\, on account of the crowd\, because he was small of stature. So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him\, for he was to pass that way. And when Jesus came to the place\, he looked up and said to him\, \"Zacchaios\, make haste and come down; for I must stay at your house today.\" So he made haste and came down\, and received him joyfully. And when they saw it they all murmured\, \"He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.\" And Zacchaios stood and said to the Lord\, \"Behold\, Lord\, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have defrauded any one of anything\, I restore it fourfold.\" And Jesus said to him\, \"Today salvation has come to this house\, since he also is a son of Abraham. For the Son of man came to seek and to save the lost.\"\n\n

For you had compassion on the prisoners\, and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property\, since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one.  Therefore do not throw away your confidence\, which has a great reward.  For you have need of endurance\, so that you may do the will of God and receive what is promised.  \"For yet a little while\, and the coming one shall come and shall not tarry; but my righteous one shall live by faith.\"\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 9:33-41\nAt that time\, Jesus and his disciples came to Capernaum\, and when he was in the house he asked them\, \"What were you discussing on the way?\"  But they were silent; for on the way they had discussed with one another who was the greatest.  And he sat down and called the twelve; and he said to them\, \"If any one would be first\, he must be last of all and servant of all.\"  And he took a child\, and put him in the midst of them; and taking him in his arms\, he said to them\, \"Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me; and whoever receives me\, receives not me but him who sent me.\"  John said to him\, \"Teacher\, we saw a man casting out demons in your name\, and we forbade him\, because he was not following us.\"  But Jesus said\, \"Do not forbid him; for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soon after to speak evil of me.

The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came that they may have life\, and have it abundantly.  I am the good shepherd.  The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.

And I have other sheep\, that are not of this fold; I must bring them also\, and they will heed my voice. So there shall be one flock\, one shepherd.\"\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 13:7-16\nBrethren\, remember your leaders\, those who spoke to you the word of God; consider the outcome of their lives\, and imitate their faith.  Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and for ever.  Do not be led away by diverse and strange teachings; for it is well that the heart be strengthened by grace\, not by foods\, which have not benefited their adherents.  We have an altar from which those who serve the tent have no right to eat.  For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned outside the camp.  So Jesus also suffered outside the gate in order to sanctify the people through his own blood.  Therefore let us go forth to him outside the camp and bear the abuse he endured.  For here we have no lasting city\, but we seek the city which is to come.  Through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God\, that is\, the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name.  Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have\, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God. \n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 5:14-19\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"You are the light of the world.  A city set on a hill cannot be hid.  Nor do men light a lamp and put it under a bushel\, but on a stand\, and it gives light to all in the house.  Let your light so shine before men\, that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.  Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfill them.  For truly\, I say to you\, till heaven and earth pass away\, not an iota\, not a dot\, will pass from the law until all is accomplished.  Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so\, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\"\n\n

And God has appointed in the church first apostles\, second prophets\, third teachers\, then workers of miracles\, then healers\, helpers\, administrators\, speakers in various kinds of tongues.  Are all apostles?  Are all prophets?  Are all teachers?  Do all work miracles?  Do all possess gifts of healing?  Do all speak with tongues?  Do all interpret?  But earnestly desire the higher gifts.  And I will show you a still more excellent way.  If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels\, but have not love\, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.  And if I have prophetic powers\, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge\, and if I have all faith\, so as to remove mountains\, but have not love\, I am nothing.  If I give away all I have\, and if I deliver my body to be burned\, but have not love\, I gain nothing. Love is patient and kind; love is not jealous or boastful; it is not arrogant or rude. Love does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrong\, but rejoices in the right. Love bears all things\, believes all things\, hopes all things\, endures all things. Love never ends.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 10:1\, 5-8\nAt that time\, Jesus called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits\, to cast them out\, and to heal every disease and every infirmity.  These twelve Jesus sent out\, charging them\, \"Go nowhere among the Gentiles\, and enter no town of the Samaritans\, but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.  And preach as you go\, saying\, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.'  Heal the sick\, raise the dead\, cleanse lepers\, cast out demons.  You received without paying\, give without pay.\"\n\n

For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son\, in order that he might be the first-born among many brethren.  And those whom he predestined he also called; and those whom he called he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified.\n\nWhat then shall we say to this?  If God is for us\, who is against us?  He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all\, will he not also give us all things with him?  Who shall bring any charge against God's elect?  It is God who justifies; who is to condemn?  It is Christ Jesus\, who died\, yes\, who was raised from the dead\, who is at the right hand of God\, who indeed intercedes for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?  Shall tribulation\, or distress\, or persecution\, or famine\, or nakedness\, or peril\, or sword?  As it is written\, \"For thy sake we are being killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.\"  No\, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.  For I am sure that neither death\, nor life\, nor angels\, nor principalities\, nor things present\, nor things to come\, nor powers\, nor height\, nor depth\, nor anything else in all creation\, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 10:19-21\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"Behold\, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions\, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall hurt you. Nevertheless do not rejoice in this\, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.\" In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said\, \"I thank you\, Father\, Lord of heaven and earth\, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes; yes\, Father\, for such was your gracious will.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:The Presentation of Our Lord and Savior in the Temple
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 02/02/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: The Presentation of Our Lord and Savior in the Temple; Gabriel the New Martyr of Constantinople; Jordan the New Martyr; Agathadoros the Martyr of Cappadocia\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Luke 2:25-32\nAt that time\, there was a man in Jerusalem\, whose name was Symeon\, and this man was righteous and devout\, looking for the consolation of Israel\, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.  And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ.  And inspired by the Spirit he came into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus\, to do for him according to the custom of the law\, he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said\, \"Lord\, now let your servant depart in peace\, according to your word; for my eyes have seen your salvation which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples\, a light for revelation to the Gentiles\, and for glory to your people Israel.\"\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 7:7-17\nBRETHREN\, it is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior. Here tithes are received by mortal men; there\, by one whom it is testified that he lives. One might even say that Levi himself\, who receives tithes\, paid tithes through Abraham\, for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him. Now if perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law)\, what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek\, rather than one named after the order of Aaron? For when there is a change in the priesthood\, there is necessarily a change in the law as well. For the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe\, from which no one has ever served at the altar. For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah\, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests. This becomes even more evident when another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek\, who has become a priest\, not according to a legal requirement concerning bodily descent but by the power of an indestructible life. For it is witnessed of him\, \"Thou art a priest for ever\, after the order of Melchizedek.\" \n\nGospel Reading: Luke 2:22-40\nAt that time\, the parents brought the child Jesus up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord (as it is written in the law of the Lord\, \"Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord\") and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord\, \"a pair of turtle doves\, or two young pigeons.\"  Now there was a man in Jerusalem\, whose name was Symeon\, and this man was righteous and devout\, looking for the consolation of Israel\, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.  And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ.  And inspired by the Spirit he came into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus\, to do for him according to the custom of the law\, he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said\,\n\n\"Lord\, now let your servant depart in peace\, according to your word; for my eyes have seen your salvation which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples\, a light for revelation to the Gentiles\, and for glory to your people Israel.\"\n\nAnd his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him; and Symeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother\, \"Behold\, this child is set for the fall and rising of many in Israel\, and for a sign that is spoken against (and a sword will pierce through your own soul also)\, that thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.\"  And there was a prophetess\, Anna\, the daughter of Phanuel\, of the tribe of Asher; she was of a great age\, having lived with her husband seven years from her virginity\, and as a widow till she was eighty-four.  She did not depart from the temple\, worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day.  And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks to God\, and spoke of him to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.  And when they had performed everything according to the law of the Lord\, they returned into Galilee\, to their own city\, Nazareth.  And the child grew and became strong\, filled with wisdom; and the favor of God was upon him.\n\n

For if the sprinkling of defiled persons with the blood of goats and bulls and with the ashes of a heifer sanctifies for the purification of the flesh\, how much more shall the blood of Christ\, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God\, purify your conscience from dead works to serve the living God. \n\nGospel Reading: Luke 2:25-38\nAt that time\, there was a man in Jerusalem\, whose name was Symeon and this man was righteous and devout\, looking for the consolation of Israel\, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.

For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous\, and his ears are open to their prayer. But the face of the Lord is against those that do evil.\"\n\nNow who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is right? But even if you do suffer for righteousness' sake\, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them\, nor be troubled\, but in your hearts reverence Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to make a defense to any one who calls you to account for the hope that is in you\, yet do it with gentleness and reverence; and keep your conscience clear\, so that\, when you are abused\, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame. For it is better to suffer for doing right\, if that should be God's will\, than for doing wrong. For Christ also died for sins once for all\, the righteous for the unrighteous\, that he might bring us to God\, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit; in which he went and preached to the spirits in prison\, who formerly did not obey\, when God's patience waited in the days of Noah\, during the building of the ark\, in which a few\, that is\, eight persons\, were saved through water. Baptism\, which corresponds to this\, now saves you\, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a clear conscience\, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ\, who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God\, with angels\, authorities\, and powers subject to him.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 12:18-27\nAt that time\, Sadducees came to Jesus\, who say that there is no resurrection; and they asked him a question\, saying\, \"Teacher\, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife\, but leaves no child\, the man must take the wife\, and raise up children for his brother. There were seven brothers; the first took a wife\, and when he died left no children; and the second took her\, and died\, leaving no children; and the third likewise; and the seven left no children. Last of all the woman also died. In the resurrection whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife.\" Jesus said to them\, \"Is not this why you are wrong\, that you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God? For when they rise from the dead\, they neither marry nor are given in marriage\, but are like angels in heaven. And as for the dead being raised\, have you not read in the book of Moses\, in the passage about the bush\, how God said to him\, 'I am the God of Abraham\, and the God of Isaac\, and the God of Jacob'? He is not God of the dead\, but of the living; you are quite wrong.\"\n\n

Let the time that is past suffice for doing what the Gentiles like to do\, living in licentiousness\, passions\, drunkenness\, revels\, carousing\, and lawless idolatry. They are surprised that you do not now join them in the same wild profligacy\, and they abuse you; but they will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. For this is why the gospel was preached even to the dead\, that though judged in the flesh like men\, they might live in the spirit like God.\n\nThe end of all things is at hand; therefore keep sane and sober for your prayers. Above all hold unfailing your love for one another\, since love covers a multitude of sins. Practice hospitality ungrudgingly to one another. As each has received a gift\, employ it for one another\, as good stewards of God's varied grace: whoever speaks\, as one who utters oracles of God; whoever renders service\, as one who renders it by the strength which God supplies; in order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To him belong glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 12:28-37\nAt that time\, one of the scribes came up to Jesus. Hearing the Sadducees disputing with him\, and seeing that he answered them well\, asked him\, \"Which commandment is the first of all?\" Jesus answered\, \"The first is\, 'Hear\, O Israel: The Lord our God\, the Lord is one; and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart\, and with all your soul\, and with all your mind\, and with all your strength.' The second is this\, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these.\" And the scribe said to him\, \"You are right\, Teacher; you have truly said that he is one\, and there is no other but he; and to love him with all the heart\, and with all the understanding\, and with all the strength\, and to love one's neighbor as oneself\, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.\" And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely\, he said to him\, \"You are not far from the kingdom of God.\" And after that no one dared to ask him any question. And as Jesus taught in the temple\, he said\, \"How can the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David? David himself\, inspired by the Holy Spirit\, declared\,\n\n'The Lord said to my Lord\, Sit at my right hand\, till I put your enemies under your feet.'\n\nDavid himself calls him Lord; so how is he his son?\" And the great throng heard him gladly.\n\n

To him the gatekeeper opens; the sheep hear his voice\, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own\, he goes before them\, and the sheep follow him\, for they know his voice. A stranger they will not follow\, but they will flee from him\, for they do not know the voice of strangers.\" This figure Jesus used with them\, but they did not understand what he was saying to them. So Jesus again said to them\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, I am the door of the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not heed them. I am the door; if any one enters by me\, he will be saved\, and will go in and out and find pasture.\"\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 7:26-28;8:1-2\nBrethren\, it was fitting that we should have such a high priest\, holy\, blameless\, unstained\, separated from sinners\, exalted above the heavens.  He has no need\, like those high priests\, to offer sacrifices daily\, first for his own sins and then for those of the people; he did this once for all when he offered up himself.  Indeed\, the law appoints men in their weakness as high priests\, but the word of the oath\, which came later than the law\, appoints a Son who has been made perfect for ever.  Now the point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest\, one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven\, a minister in the sanctuary and the true tent which is set up not by man but by the Lord. \n\nGospel Reading: John 10:9-16\nThe Lord said\, \"I am the door; if any one enters by me\, he will be saved\, and will go in and out and find pasture.  The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came that they may have life\, and have it abundantly.  I am the good shepherd.  The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.  He who is a hireling and not a shepherd\, whose own the sheep are not\, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.  He flees because he is a hireling and cares nothing for the sheep.  I am the good shepherd; I know my own and my own know me\, as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.  And I have other sheep\, that are not of this fold; I must bring them also\, and they will heed my voice. So there shall be one flock\, one shepherd.\"\n\n

For this very reason make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue\, and virtue with knowledge\, and knowledge with self-control\, and self-control with steadfastness\, and steadfastness with godliness\, and godliness with brotherly affection\, and brotherly affection with love. For if these things are yours and abound\, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Therefore\, brethren\, be the more zealous to confirm your call and election\, for if you do this you will never fall.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 13:1-8\nAt that time\, as Jesus came out of the temple\, one of his disciples said to him\, \"Look\, Teacher\, what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!\" And Jesus said to him\, \"Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone upon another\, that will not be thrown down.\" And as he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple\, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately\, \"Tell us\, when will this be\, and what will be the sign when these things are all to be accomplished?\" And Jesus began to say to them\, \"Take heed that no one leads you astray.

And he said to Simon Peter\, \"Simon\, son of John\, do you love me more than these?\" He said to him\, \"Yes\, Lord; you know that I love you.\" He said to him\, \"Feed my lambs.\" A second time he said to him\, \"Simon\, son of John\, do you love me?\" He said to him\, \"Yes\, Lord; you know that I love you.\" He said to him\, \"Tend my sheep.\" He said to him the third time\, \"Simon\, son of John\, do you love me?\" Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time\, \"Do you love me?\" And he said to him\, \"Lord\, you know everything; you know that I love you.\" Jesus said to him\, \"Feed my sheep. Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, when you were young\, you girded yourself and walked where you would; but when you are old\, you will stretch out your hands\, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go.\" (This he said to show by what death he was to glorify God.) And after this he said to him\, \"Follow me.\" Peter turned and saw following them the disciple whom Jesus loved\, who had lain close to his breast at the supper and had said\, \"Lord\, who is it that is going to betray you?\" When Peter saw him\, he said to Jesus\, \"Lord\, what about this man?\" Jesus said to him\, \"If it is my will that he remain until I come\, what is that to you? Follow me!\" The saying spread abroad among the brethren that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die\, but\, \"If it is my will that he remain until I come\, what is that to you?\" This is the disciple who is bearing witness to these things\, and who has written these things; and we know that his testimony is true.

Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. No soldier on service gets entangled in civilian pursuits\, since his aim is to satisfy the one who enlisted him. An athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. It is the hardworking farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops. Think over what I say\, for the Lord will grant you understanding in everything.\n\nRemember Jesus Christ\, risen from the dead\, descended from David\, as preached in my gospel\, the gospel for which I am suffering and wearing fetters like a criminal. But the word of God is not fettered. Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect\, that they also may obtain salvation in Christ Jesus with its eternal glory.\n\nGospel Reading: John 15:17-27; 16:1-2\nThe Lord said to his disciples: \"This I command you\, to love one another.  If the world hates you\, know that it has hated me before it hated you.  If you were of the world\, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world\, but I chose you out of the world\, therefore the world hates you.  Remember the word that I said to you\, 'A servant is not greater than his master.'  If they persecuted me\, they will persecute you; if they kept my word\, they will keep yours also.  But all this they will do to you on my account\, because they do not know him who sent me.  If I had not come and spoken to them\, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.  He who hates me hates my Father also.  If I had not done among them the works which no one else did\, they would not have sin; but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father.  It is to fulfill the word that is written in their law\, 'They hated me without a cause.'\n\n  But when the Counselor comes\, whom I shall send to you from the Father\, even the Spirit of truth\, who proceeds from the Father\, he will bear witness to me; and you also are witnesses\, because you have been with me from the beginning.  I have said all this to you to keep you from falling away.  They will put you out of the synagogues; indeed\, the hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Blaise the Hieromartyr of Sebastia
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 02/11/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Blaise the Hieromartyr of Sebastia; Theodora the Empress; Finding of the relics of Zachariah the Prophet\, Father of the Holy Forerunner; George the Serbian\n\nFast Free\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 4:14-16;5:1-6\nBRETHREN\, since we have a high priest who has passed through the heavens\, Jesus\, the Son of God\, let us hold fast our confession. For we have not a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses\, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are\, yet without sin. Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace\, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. For every high priest chosen from among men is appointed to act on behalf of men in relation to God\, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. He can deal gently with the ignorant and wayward\, since he himself is beset with weakness. Because of this he is bound to offer sacrifice for his own sins as well as for those of the people. And one does not take the honor upon himself\, but he is called by God\, just as Aaron was. So also Christ did not exalt himself to be made a high priest\, but was appointed by him who said to him\, \"Thou art my Son\, today I have begotten thee\"; as he says also in another place\, \"Thou art a priest for ever\, after the order of Melchizedek.\" \n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 10:1\, 5-8\nAt that time\, Jesus called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits\, to cast them out\, and to heal every disease and every infirmity.  These twelve Jesus sent out\, charging them\, \"Go nowhere among the Gentiles\, and enter no town of the Samaritans\, but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.  And preach as you go\, saying\, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.'  Heal the sick\, raise the dead\, cleanse lepers\, cast out demons.  You received without paying\, give without pay.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Meletius\, Archbishop of Antioch
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 02/12/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Meletius\, Archbishop of Antioch; Antonius\, Archbishop of Constantinople; Meletios of Ypseni; Christos the New Martyr\n\nFast Free\n\nEpistle Reading: II Peter 3:1-18\nBeloved\, this is now the second letter that I have written to you\, and in both of them I have aroused your sincere mind by way of reminder; that you should remember the predictions of the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior through your apostles.  First of all you must understand this\, that scoffers will come in the last days with scoffing\, following their own passions and saying\, \"Where is the promise of his coming?  For ever since the fathers fell asleep\, all things have continued as they were from the beginning of creation.\"  They deliberately ignore this fact\, that by the word of God heavens existed long ago\, and an earth formed out of water and by means of water\, through which the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished.  But by the same word the heavens and earth that now exist have been stored up for fire\, being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.\n\nBut do not ignore this one fact\, beloved\, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years\, and a thousand years as one day.  The Lord is not slow about his promise as some count slowness\, but is forbearing toward you\, not wishing that any should perish\, but that all should reach repentance.  But the day of the Lord will come like a thief\, and then the heavens will pass away with a loud noise\, and the elements will be dissolved with fire\, and the earth and the works that are upon it will be burned up.\n\nSince all these things are thus to be dissolved\, what sort of persons ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness\, waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God\, because of which the heavens will be kindled and dissolved\, and the elements will melt with fire!  But according to his promise we wait for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.\n\nTherefore\, beloved\, since you wait for these\, be zealous to be found by him without spot or blemish\, and at peace.  And count the forbearance of our Lord as salvation.  So also our beloved brother Paul wrote to you according to the wisdom given him\, speaking of this as he does in all his letters.  There are some things in them hard to understand\, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction\, as they do the other scriptures.  You therefore\, beloved\, knowing this beforehand\, beware lest you be carried away with the error of lawless men and lose your own stability.  But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity.  Amen.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 13:24-31\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"In those days\, after that tribulation\, the sun will be darkened\, and the moon will not give its light\, and the stars will be falling from heaven\, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.  And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory.  And he will send out the angels\, and gather his elect from the four winds\, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.  From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves\, you know that summer is near.  So also\, when you see these things taking place\, you know he is near\, at the very gates.  Truly\, I say to you\, this generation will not pass away before all these things take place.  Heaven and earth will pass away\, but my words will not pass away.\"\n\n

If we confess our sins\, he is faithful and just\, and will forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.  If we say we have not sinned\, we make him a liar\, and his word is not in us.  My little children\, I am writing this to you so that you may not sin; but if any one does sin\, we have an advocate with the Father\, Jesus Christ the righteous; and he is the expiation for our sins\, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world.  And by this we may be sure that we know him\, if we keep his commandments.  He who says \"I know him\" but disobeys his commandments is a liar\, and the truth is not in him; but whoever keeps his word\, in him truly love for God is perfected.  By this we may be sure that we are in him: he who says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked. \n\nGospel Reading: Mark 13:31-37: 14:1-2\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"Heaven and earth will pass away\, but my words will not pass away.  But of that day or that hour no one knows\, not even the angels in heaven\, nor the Son\, but only the Father.  Take heed\, watch; for you do not know when the time will come.  It is like a man going on a journey\, when he leaves home and puts his servants in charge\, each with his work\, and commands the doorkeeper to be on the watch.  Watch therefore -- for you do not know when the master of the house will come\, in the evening\, or at midnight\, or at cockcrow\, or in the morning -- lest he come suddenly and find you asleep.  And what I say to you I say to all: Watch.\"  It was now two days before the Passover and the feast of Unleavened Bread. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to arrest him by stealth\, and kill him; for they said\, \"Not during the feast\, lest there be a tumult of the people.\"\n\n

Yet I am writing you a new commandment\, which is true in him and in you\, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.  He who says he is in the light and hates his brother is in the darkness still.  He who loves his brother abides in the light\, and in it there is no cause for stumbling.  But he who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness\, and does not know where he is going\, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.  I am writing to you\, little children\, because your sins are forgiven for his sake.  I am writing to you\, fathers\, because you know him who is from the beginning.  I am writing to you\, young men\, because you have overcome the evil one.  I write to you\, children\, because you know the Father.  I write to you\, fathers\, because you know him who is from the beginning.  I write to you\, young men\, because you are strong\, and the word of God abides in you\, and you have overcome the evil one.  Do not love the world or the things in the world.  If any one loves the world\, love for the Father is not in him.  For all that is in the world\, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life\, is not of the Father but is of the world.  And the world passes away\, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides for ever. \n\nGospel Reading: Mark 14:3-9\nAt that time\, while Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper\, as he sat at table\, a woman came with an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard\, very costly\, and she broke the flask and poured it over his head.  But there were some who said to themselves indignantly\, \"Why was the ointment thus wasted?  For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii\, and given to the poor.\"  And they reproached her.  But Jesus said\, \"Let her alone; why do you trouble her?  She has done a beautiful thing to me.  For you always have the poor with you\, and whenever you will\, you can do good to them; but you will not always have me.  She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for burying.  And truly\, I say to you\, wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world\, what she has done will be told in memory of her.\"\n\n

I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers\, because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and all the saints\, and I pray that the sharing of your faith may promote the knowledge of all the good that is ours in Christ. For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love\, my brother\, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you. Accordingly\, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required\, yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you - I\, Paul\, an ambassador and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus - I appeal to you for my child\, Onesimos\, whose father I have become in my imprisonment. (Formerly he was useless to you\, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.) I am sending him back to you\, sending my very heart. I would have been glad to keep him with me\, in order that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel; but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be by compulsion but of your own free will. Perhaps this is why he was parted from you for a while\, that you might have him back for ever\, no longer as a slave but more than a slave\, as a beloved brother\, especially to me but how much more to you\, both in the flesh and in the Lord. So if you consider me your partner\, receive him as you would receive me. If he has wronged you at all\, or owes you anything\, charge that to my account. I\, Paul\, write this with my own hand\, I will repay it - to say nothing of your owing me even your own self. Yes\, brother\, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ. Confident of your obedience\, I write to you\, knowing that you will do even more than I say. At the same time\, prepare a guest room for me\, for I am hoping through your prayers to be granted to you. Epaphras\, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus\, sends greetings to you\, and so do Mark\, Aristarchos\, Demas\, and Luke\, my fellow workers. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 20:46-47; 21:1-4\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"Beware of the scribes\, who like to go about in long robes\, and love salutations in the market places and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts\, who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers.  They will receive the greater condemnation.\"  He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury; and he saw a poor widow put in two copper coins.  And he said\, \"Truly\, I tell you\, this poor widow has put in more than all of them; for they all contributed out of their abundance\, but she out of her poverty put in all the living that she had.\"  Having said this\, he proclaimed\, \"He who has ears let him hear.\"\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 02/16/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Sunday of the Prodigal Son; Pamphilus the Martyr & his Companions; Flavianos\, Patriarch of Constantinople; Romanos the Younger\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Matthew 28:16-20\nAt that time\, the eleven disciples went to Galilee\, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them. And when they saw Him they worshiped Him; but some doubted. And Jesus came and said to them\, \"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations\, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit\, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo\, I am with you always\, to the close of the age. Amen.\"\n\nEpistle Reading: I Corinthians 6:12-20\nBrethren\, \"all things are lawful for me\,\" but not all things are helpful.  \"All things are lawful for me\,\" but I will not be enslaved by anything.  \"Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food\" -- and God will destroy both one and the other.  The body is not meant for immorality\, but for the Lord\, and the Lord for the body.  And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power.  Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?  Shall I therefore take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute?  Never!  Do you not know that he who joins himself to a prostitute becomes one body with her?  For\, as it is written\, \"The two shall become one flesh.\"  But he who is united to the Lord becomes one spirit with him.  Shun immorality.  Every other sin which a man commits is outside the body; but the immoral man sins against his own body.  Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you\, which you have from God?  You are not your own; you were bought with a price.  So glorify God in your body and in your spirit which belong to God. \n\nGospel Reading: Luke 15:11-32\nThe Lord said this parable: \"There was a man who had two sons; and the younger of them said to his father\, 'Father\, give me the share of the property that falls to me.'  And he divided his living between them.  Not many days later\, the younger son gathered all he had and took his journey into a far country\, and there he squandered his property in loose living.  And when he had spent everything\, a great famine arose in that country\, and he began to be in want.  So he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country\, who sent him into his fields to feed swine.  And he would gladly have filled his belly with the pods that the swine ate; and no one gave him anything.  But when he came to himself he said\, 'How many of my father's hired servants have bread enough and to spare\, but I perish here with hunger!  I will arise and go to my father\, and I will say to him\, 'Father\, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me as one of your hired servants.'  And he arose and came to his father.  But while he was yet at a distance\, his father saw him and had compassion\, and ran and embraced him and kissed him.  And the son said to him\, 'Father\, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'  But the father said to his servants\, 'Bring quickly the best robe\, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand\, and shoes on his feet; and bring the fatted calf and kill it\, and let us eat and make merry; for this my son was dead\, and is alive again; he was lost\, and is found.'  And they began to make merry.  Now his elder son was in the field; and as he came and drew near to the house\, he heard music and dancing.  And he called one of the servants and asked what this meant.  And he said to him\, 'Your brother has come\, and your father has killed the fatted calf\, because he has received him safe and sound.'  But he was angry and refused to go in.  His father came out and entreated him\, but he answered his father\, 'Lo\, these many years I have served you\, and I never disobeyed your command; yet you never gave me a kid\, that I might make merry with my friends.  But when this son of yours came\, who has devoured your living with harlots\, you killed for him the fatted calf!'  And he said to him\, 'Son\, you are always with me\, and all that is mine is yours.  It was fitting to make merry and be glad\, for this your brother was dead\, and is alive; he was lost\, and is found.'\"\n\n

By this it may be seen who are the children of God\, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not do right is not of God\, nor he who does not love his brother. For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning\, that we should love one another\, and not be like Cain who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother's righteous. Do not wonder\, brethren\, that the world hates you. We know that we have passed out of death into life\, because we love the brethren. He who does not love abides in death. Any one who hates his brother is a murderer\, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. By this we know love\, that he laid down his life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. But if any one has the world's goods and sees his brother in need\, yet closes his heart against him\, how does God's love abide in him? Little children\, let us not love in word or speech but in deed and in truth. By this we shall know that we are of the truth\, and reassure our hearts before him whenever our hearts condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts\, and he knows everything. Beloved\, if our hearts do not condemn us\, we have confidence before God; and we receive from him whatever we ask. \n\nGospel Reading: Mark 14:10-42\nAt that time\, Judas Iscariot\, who was one of the twelve\, went to the chief priests in order to betray Jesus to them. And when they heard it they were glad\, and promised to give him money. And he sought an opportunity to betray him. And on the first day of Unleavened Bread\, when they sacrificed the passover lamb\, his disciples said to him\, \"Where will you have us go and prepare for you to eat the passover?\" And he sent two of his disciples\, and said to them\, \"Go into the city\, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him\, and wherever he enters\, say to the householder\, 'The Teacher says\, Where is my guest room\, where I am to eat the passover with my disciples?' And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready; there prepare for us.\" And the disciples set out and went to the city\, and found it as he had told them; and they prepared the passover. And when it was evening he came with the twelve. And as they were at table eating\, Jesus said\, \"Truly\, I say to you\, one of you will betray me\, one who is eating with me.\" They began to be sorrowful\, and to say to him one after another\, \"Is it I?\" He said to them\, \"It is one of the twelve\, one who is dipping bread into the dish with me. For the Son of man goes as it is written of him\, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.\" And as they were eating\, he took bread\, and blessed\, and broke it\, and gave it to them\, and said\, \"Take; this is my body.\" And he took a cup\, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them\, and they all drank of it. And he said to them\, \"This is my blood of the new covenant\, which is poured out for many. Truly\, I say to you\, I shall not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.\" And when they had sung a hymn\, they went out to the Mount of Olives. And Jesus said to them\, \"You will all fall away; for it is written\, 'I will strike the shepherd\, and the sheep will be scattered.' But after I am raised up\, I will go before you to Galilee.\" Peter said to him\, \"Even though they all fall away\, I will not.\" And Jesus said to him\, \"Truly\, I say to you\, this very night\, before the cock crows twice\, you will deny me three times.\" But he said vehemently\, \"If I must die with you\, I will not deny you.\" And they all said the same. And they went to a place which was called Gethsemane; and he said to his disciples\, \"Sit here\, while I pray.\" And he took with him Peter and James and John\, and began to be greatly distressed and troubled. And he said to them\, \"My soul is very sorrowful\, even to death; remain here\, and watch.\" And going a little farther\, he fell on the ground and prayed that\, if it were possible\, the hour might pass from him. And he said\, 'Abba\, Father\, all things are possible to you; remove this cup from me; yet not what I will\, but what you will.\" And he came and found them sleeping\, and he said to Peter\, \"Simon\, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour? Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing\, but the flesh is weak.\" And again he went away and prayed\, saying the same words. And again he came and found them sleeping\, for their eyes were very heavy; and they did not know what to answer him. And he came the third time\, and said to them\, \"Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? It is enough; the hour has come; the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise\, let us be going; see\, my betrayer is at hand.\"\n\n

And this is his commandment\, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another\, just as he has commanded us.  All who keep his commandments abide in him\, and he in them.  And by this we know that he abides in us\, by the Spirit which he has given us.\n\nBeloved\, do not believe every spirit\, but test the spirits to see whether they are of God; for many false prophets have gone out into the world.  By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God\, and every spirit which does not confess Jesus is not of God.  This is the spirit of antichrist\, of which you heard that it was coming\, and now it is in the world already.  Little children\, you are of God\, and have overcome them; for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.  They are of the world\, therefore what they say is of the world\, and the world listens to them.  We are of God.  Whoever knows God listens to us\, and he who is not of God does not listen to us.  By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.\n\nBeloved\, let us love one another; for love is of God\, and he who loves is born of God and knows God.  He who does not love does not know God; for God is love.  In this the love of God was made manifest among us\, that God sent his only Son into the world\, so that we might live through him.  In this is love\, not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the expiation for our sins.  Beloved\, if God so loved us\, we also ought to love one another. \n\nGospel Reading: Mark 14:43-72; 15:1\nAt that time\, while Jesus was speaking to the disciples\, Judas Iscariot came\, one of the twelve\, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs\, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.  Now the betrayer had given them a sign\, saying\, \"The one I shall kiss is the man; seize him and lead him away under guard.\"  And when he came\, he went up to him at once\, and said\, \"Rabbi!\"  And he kissed him.  And they laid hands on him and seized him.  But one of those who stood by drew his sword\, and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear.  And Jesus said to them\, \"Have you come out as against a robber\, with swords and clubs to capture me?  Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching\, and you did not seize me.  But let the scriptures be fulfilled.\"  And they all forsook him\, and fled.  And a young man followed him\, with nothing but a linen cloth about his body; and they seized him\, but he left the linen cloth and ran away naked.  And they led Jesus to the high priest; and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes were assembled.  And Peter had followed him at a distance\, right into the courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting with the guards\, and warming himself at the fire.  Now the chief priests and the whole council sought testimony against Jesus to put him to death; but they found none.  For many bore false witness against him\, and their witness did not agree.  And some stood up and bore false witness against him\, saying\, \"We heard him say\, 'I will destroy this temple that is made with hands\, and in three days I will build another\, not made with hands.'\"  Yet not even so did their testimony agree.  And the high priest stood up in the midst\, and asked Jesus\, \"Have you no answer to make?  What is it that these men testify against you?\"  But he was silent and made no answer.  Again the high priest asked him\, \"Are you the Christ\, the Son of the Blessed?\"  And Jesus said\, \"I am; and you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of Power\, and coming with the clouds of heaven.\"  And the high priest tore his garments\, and said\, \"Why do we still need witnesses?  You have heard his blasphemy.  What is your decision?\"  And they all condemned him as deserving death.  And some began to spit on him\, and to cover his face\, and to strike him\, saying to him\, \"Prophesy!\"  And the guards received him with blows.  And as Peter was below in the courtyard\, one of the maids of the high priest came; and seeing Peter warming himself\, she looked at him\, and said\, \"You also were with the Nazarene\, Jesus.\"  But he denied it\, saying\, \"I neither know nor understand what you mean.\"  And he went out into the gateway\, and the cock crowed.  And the maid saw him\, and began again to say to the bystanders\, \"This man is one of them.\"  But again he denied it.  And after a little while again the bystanders said to Peter\, \"Certainly you are one of them; for you are a Galilean.\"  But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear\, \"I do not know this man of whom you speak.\"  And immediately the cock crowed a second time.  And Peter remembered how Jesus had said to him\, \"Before the cock crows twice\, you will deny me three times.\"  And he broke down and wept.  And as soon as it was morning the chief priests\, with the elders and scribes\, and the whole council held a consultation; and they bound Jesus and led him away and delivered him to Pilate.\n\n

SUMMARY:Leo\, Bishop of Catania
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 02/20/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Leo\, Bishop of Catania; Agathus\, Pope of Rome; Bessarion the Great; Sadok the Bishop and the 128 other Martyrs of Persia; Plotinus\n\nEpistle Reading: I John 4:20-21;5:1-21\nBeloved\, if any one says\, \"I love God\,\" and hates his brother\, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen\, cannot love God whom he has not seen.  And this commandment we have from him\, that he who loves God should love his brother also.\n\nEvery one who believes that Jesus is the Christ is a child of God\, and every one who loves the parent loves the child.  By this we know that we love the children of God\, when we love God and obey his commandments.  For this is the love of God\, that we keep his commandments.  And his commandments are not burdensome.  For whatever is born of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory that overcomes the world\, our faith.  Who is it that overcomes the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?\n\nThis is he who came by water and blood\, Jesus Christ\, not with the water only but with the water and the blood.  And the Spirit is the witness\, because the Spirit is the truth.  There are three witnesses\, the Spirit\, the water\, and the blood; and these three agree.  If we receive the testimony of men\, the testimony of God is greater; for this is the testimony of God that he has borne witness to his Son.  He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself.  He who does not believe God has made him a liar\, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne to his Son.  And this is the testimony\, that God gave us eternal life\, and this life is in his Son.  He who has the Son has life; he who has not the Son of God has not life.\n\nI write this to you who believe in the name of the Son of God\, that you may know that you have eternal life.  And this is the confidence which we have in him\, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us.  And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask\, we know that we have obtained the requests made of him.  If any one sees his brother committing what is not a mortal sin\, he will ask\, and God will give him life for those whose sin is not mortal.  There is sin which is mortal; I do not say that one is to pray for that.  All wrongdoing is sin\, but there is sin which is not mortal.\n\nWe know that any one born of God does not sin\, but He who was born of God keeps him\, and the evil one does not touch him.\n\nWe know that we are of God\, and the whole world is in the power of the evil one.\n\nAnd we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding\, to know him who is true; and we are in him who is true\, in his Son Jesus Christ.  This is the true God and eternal life.  Little children\, keep yourselves from idols.  Amen. \n\nGospel Reading: Mark 15:1-15\nAt that time\, the chief priests\, with the elders\, and scribes and the whole council held a consultation; and they bound Jesus and led him away and delivered him to Pilate.  And Pilate asked him\, \"Are you the King of the Jews?\"  And he answered him\, \"You have said so.\"  And the chief priests accused him of many things.  And Pilate again asked him\, \"Have you no answer to make?  See how many charges they bring against you.\"  But Jesus made no further answer\, so that Pilate wondered.  Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner for whom they asked.  And among the rebels in prison\, who had committed murder in the insurrection\, there was a man called Barabbas.  And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he was wont to do for them.  And he answered them\, \"Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?\"  For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up.  But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead.  And Pilate again said to them\, \"Then what shall I do with the man whom you call the King of the Jews?\"  And they cried out again\, \"Crucify him.\"  And Pilate said to them\, \"Why\, what evil has he done?\"  But they shouted all the more\, \"Crucify him.\"  So Pilate\, wishing to satisfy the crowd\, released for them Barabbas; and having scourged Jesus\, he delivered him to be crucified.\n\n

SUMMARY:Timothy the Righteous
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 02/21/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Timothy the Righteous; John III\, Patriarch of Constantinople; Eustathius\, Bishop of Antioch; Zachariah\, Patriarch of Jerusalem\n\nStrict Fast\n\nEpistle Reading: II John 1:1-13\nThe elder to the elect lady and her children\, whom I love in the truth\, and not only I but also all who know the truth\, because of the truth which abides in us and will be with us for ever:\n\nGrace\, mercy\, and peace will be with us\, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Father's Son\, in truth and love.\n\nI rejoiced greatly to find some of your children following the truth\, just as we have been commanded by the Father.  And now I beg you\, lady\, not as though I were writing you a new commandment\, but the one we have had from the beginning\, that we love one another.  And this is love\, that we follow his commandments; this is the commandment\, as you have heard from the beginning\, that you follow love.  For many deceivers have gone out into the world\, men who will not acknowledge the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh; such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist.  Look to yourselves\, that you may not lose what you have worked for\, but may win a full reward.  Any one who goes ahead and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God; he who abides in the doctrine has both the Father and the Son.  If any one comes to you and does not bring this doctrine\, do not receive him into the house or give him any greeting; for he who greets him shares his wicked work.\n\nThough I have much to write to you\, I would rather not use paper and ink\, but I hope to come to see you and talk with you face to face\, so that our joy may be complete.\n\nThe children of your elect sister greet you.  Amen. \n\nGospel Reading: Mark 15:20\,22\,25\,33-41\nAt that time\, the soldiers took Jesus and led him out to be crucified.  And they brought him to a place called Golgotha (which means the place of a skull).  And it was the third hour\, when they crucified him.  And when the sixth hour had come there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.  And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice\, \"Eloi\, Eloi\, lama sabachthani?\" which means\, \"My God\, my God\, why have you forsaken me?\"  And some of the bystanders hearing it said\, \"Behold\, he is calling Elijah. \"  And one ran and\, filling a sponge full of vinegar\, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink\, saying\, \"Wait\, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down.\"  And Jesus uttered a loud cry\, and breathed his last.  And the curtain of the temple was torn in two\, from top to bottom.  And when the centurion\, who stood facing him\, saw that he thus cried out and breathed his last\, he said\, \"Truly this man was the Son of God!  There were also women looking on from afar\, among whom were Mary Magdalene\, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses\, and Salome who\, when he was in Galilee\, followed him\, and ministered to him; and also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.\n\n

SUMMARY:Saturday of Souls
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 02/22/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Saturday of Souls; The Finding of the Precious Relics of the Holy Martyrs in the Quarter of Eugenius; Our Righteous Fathers Thalassius and Baradatus; Anthousa the Martyr & her 12 Servants\n\nEpistle Reading: I Thessalonians 4:13-17\nBut we would not have you ignorant\, brethren\, concerning those who are asleep\, that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope.  For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again\, even so\, through Jesus\, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep.  For this we declare to you by the word of the Lord\, that we who are alive\, who are left until the coming of the Lord\, shall not precede those who have fallen asleep.  For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command\, with the archangel's call\, and with the sound of the trumpet of God.  And the dead in Christ will rise first; then we who are alive\, who are left\, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so we shall always be with the Lord.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 21:8-9\,25-27\,33-36\nThe Lord said\, \"Take heed that you are not led astray; for many will come in my name\, saying\, 'I am he!' and\, 'The time is at hand!'  Do not go after them.  And when you hear of wars and tumults\, do not be terrified; for this must first take place\, but the end will not be at once.  And there will be signs in sun and moon and stars\, and upon the earth distress of nations in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the waves\, men fainting with fear and with foreboding of what is coming on the world; for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.  And then they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.  Heaven and earth will pass away\, but my words will not pass away.  But take heed to yourselves lest your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and cares of life\, and that day come upon you suddenly like a snare; for it will come upon all who dwell upon the face of the whole earth.  But watch at all times\, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that will take place\, and to stand before the Son of man.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Judgment Sunday (Meatfare Sunday)
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 02/23/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Judgment Sunday (Meatfare Sunday); Polycarp the Holy Martyr & Bishop of Smyrna; Proterios\, Archbishop of Alexandria; Gorgonia the Righteous\, sister of Gregory the Theologian; Damian the New Martyr of Mount Athos; Boswell\, Abbot of Melrose Abbey\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Mark 16:1-8\nWhen the Sabbath was past\, Mary Magdalene\, and Mary the mother of James and Salome\, bought spices\, so that they might go and anoint Jesus. And very early on the first day of the week they went to the tomb when the sun had risen. And they were saying to one another\, \"Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the tomb?\" And looking up\, they saw that the stone was rolled back - it was very large. And entering the tomb\, they saw a young man sitting on the right side\, dressed in a white robe; and they were amazed. And he said to them\, \"Do not be amazed; you seek Jesus of Nazareth\, who was crucified. He has risen\, He is not here; see the place where they laid Him. But go\, tell His disciples and Peter that He is going before you to Galilee; there you will see Him\, as He told you.\" And they went out and fled from the tomb\, for trembling and astonishment had come upon them; and they said nothing to anyone\, for they were afraid.\n\nEpistle Reading: I Corinthians 8:8-13;9:1-2\nBrethren\, food will not commend us to God.  We are no worse off if we do not eat\, and no better off if we do.  Only take care lest this liberty of yours somehow become a stumbling block to the weak.  For if any one sees you\, a man of knowledge\, at table in an idol's temple\, might he not be encouraged\, if his conscience is weak\, to eat food offered to idols?  And so by your knowledge this weak man is destroyed\, the brother for whom Christ died.  Thus\, sinning against your brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak\, you sin against Christ.  Therefore\, if food is a cause of my brother's falling\, I will never eat meat\, lest I cause my brother to fall.\n\nAm I not free?  Am I not an apostle?  Have I not seen Jesus our Lord?  Are not you my workmanship in the Lord?  If to others I am not an apostle\, at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord. \n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 25:31-46\nThe Lord said\, \"When the Son of man comes in his glory and all the holy angels with him\, then he will sit on his glorious throne.  Before him will be gathered all the nations\, and he will separate them one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats\, and he will place the sheep at his right hand\, but the goats at the left.  Then the king will say to those at his right hand\, 'Come\, O blessed of my Father\, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave me food\, I was thirsty and you gave me drink\, I was a stranger and you welcomed me\, I was naked and you clothed me\, I was sick and you visited me\, I was in prison and you came to me.'  Then the righteous will answer him\, 'Lord\, when did we see you hungry and feed you\, or thirsty and give you drink?  And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you\, or naked and clothe you?  And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?'  And the King will answer them\, 'Truly\, I say to you\, as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren\, you did it to me.'  Then he will say to those at his left hand\, 'Depart from me\, you cursed\, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels; for I was hungry and you gave me no food\, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink\, I was a stranger and you did not welcome me\, naked and you did not clothe me\, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.'  Then they also will answer\, 'Lord\, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison\, and did not minister to you?'  Then he will answer them\, 'Truly\, I say to you\, as you did it not to one of the least of these\, you did it not to me.'  And they will go away into eternal punishment\, but the righteous into eternal life.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:First & Second Finding of the Venerable Head of John the Baptist
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 02/24/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: First & Second Finding of the Venerable Head of John the Baptist; Romanos\, Prince of Uglich; Boswell\, Abbot of Melrose Abbey; Cumine the White\, Abbot of Iona\n\nFast Day (Dairy\, Eggs\, and Fish Allowed)\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Luke 7:17-30\nAt that time\, the report concerning Jesus spread through the whole of Judea and all the surrounding country. The disciples of John told him of all these things. And John\, calling to him two of his disciples\, sent them to the Lord\, saying\, \"Are you he who is to come\, or shall we look for another?\" And when the men had come to him\, they said\, \"John the Baptist has sent us to you\, saying\, 'Are you he who is to come\, or shall we look for another?'\" In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits\, and on many that were blind he bestowed sight. And he answered them\, \"Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight\, the lame walk\, lepers are cleansed\, and the deaf hear\, the dead are raised up\, the poor have good news preached to them. And blessed is he who takes no offense at me.\"\n\nWhen the messengers of John had gone\, he began to speak to the crowds concerning John: \"What did you go out into the wilderness to behold? A reed shaken by the wind? What then did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold\, those who are gorgeously appareled and live in luxury are in kings' courts. What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes\, I tell you\, and more than a prophet. This is he of whom it is written\, 'Behold\, I send my messenger before your face\, who shall prepare your way before you.' I tell you\, among those born of women none is greater than John; yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\" When they heard this all the people and the tax collectors justified God\, having been baptized with the baptism of John; but the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the purpose of God for themselves\, not having been baptized by him.\n\nEpistle Reading: II Corinthians 4:6-15\nBrethren\, it is the God who said\, \"Let light shine out of darkness\,\" who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.\n\nBut we have this treasure in earthen vessels\, to show that the transcendent power belongs to God and not to us.  We are afflicted in every way\, but not crushed; perplexed\, but not driven to despair; persecuted\, but not forsaken; struck down\, but not destroyed; always carrying in the body the death of Jesus\, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies.  For while we live we are always being given up to death for Jesus' sake\, so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.  So death is at work in us\, but life in you.\n\nSince we have the same spirit of faith as he had who wrote\, \"I believed\, and so I spoke\,\" we too believe\, and so we speak\, knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence.  For it is all for your sake\, so that as grace extends to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving\, to the glory of God.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 11:2-15\nAt that time\, when John heard in prison about the deeds of the Christ\, he sent word by his disciples and said to him\, \"Are you he who is to come\, or shall we look for another?\" And Jesus answered them\, \"Go and tell John what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight and the lame walk\, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear\, and the dead are raised up\, and the poor have good news preached to them. And blessed is he who takes no offense at me.\" As they went away\, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: \"What did you go out into the wilderness to behold? A reed shaken by the wind? What then did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold\, those who wear soft raiment are in kings' houses. What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes\, I tell you\, and more than a prophet. This is he of whom it is written\, 'Behold\, I send my messenger before your face\, who shall prepare your way before you.' Truly\, I say to you\, among those born of women there has risen no one greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has been coming violently and men of violence take it by force. For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John; and if you are willing to accept it\, he is Elijah who is to come. He who has ears to hear\, let him hear.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Tarasius\, Patriarch of Constantinople
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 02/25/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Tarasius\, Patriarch of Constantinople; Reginos\, Bishop of Skopelos; Holy Martyr Alexander of Thrace; Markellos\, Bishop of Apamea\n\nFast Day (Dairy\, Eggs\, and Fish Allowed)\n\nEpistle Reading: Jude 1:1-10\nJude\, a servant of Jesus Christ\, and brother of James\,\n\nTo those who are called\, beloved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ:\n\nMay mercy\, peace\, and love be multiplied to you.\n\nBeloved\, being very eager to write to you of our common salvation\, I found it necessary to write appealing to you to contend for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints.  For admission has been secretly gained by some who long ago were designated for this condemnation\, ungodly persons who pervert the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny the only Master and our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nNow I desire to remind you\, though you were once for all fully informed\, that the Lord saved a people out of the land of Egypt\, afterward destroyed those who did not believe.  And the angels that did not keep their own position but left their proper dwelling have been kept by him in eternal chains in the nether gloom until the judgment of the great day; just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities\, which likewise acted immorally and indulged in unnatural lust\, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire.\n\nYet in like manner these men in their dreamings defile the flesh\, reject authority\, and revile the glorious ones.  But when the archangel Michael\, contending with the devil\, disputed about the body of Moses\, he did not presume to pronounce a reviling judgment upon him\, but said\, \"The Lord rebuke you.\"  But these men revile whatever they do not understand\, and by those things that they know by instinct as irrational animals\, they are destroyed. \n\nGospel Reading: Luke 22:39-42\, 45-71; 23:1\nAt that time\, when Jesus came out\, he went\, as was his custom\, to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples followed him.  And when he came to the place he said to them\, \"Pray that you may not enter into temptation.\"  And he withdrew from them about a stone's throw\, and knelt down and prayed\, \"Father\, if you are willing\, remove this cup from me; nevertheless not my will\, but yours\, be done.\"  And when he rose from prayer\, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow\, and he said to them\, \"Why do you sleep?  Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.\"\n\nWhile he was still speaking\, there came a crowd\, and the man called Judas\, one of the twelve\, was leading them.  He drew near to Jesus to kiss him; but Jesus said to him\, \"Judas\, would you betray the Son of man with a kiss?\"  And when those who were about him saw what would follow\, they said\, \"Lord\, shall we strike with the sword?\"  And one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear.  But Jesus said\, \"No more of this!\"  And he touched his ear and healed him.  Then Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders\, who had come out against him\, \"Have you come out as against a robber\, with swords and clubs?  When I was with you day after day in the temple\, you did not lay hands on me.  But this is your hour\, and the power of darkness.\"\n\nThen they seized him and led him away\, bringing him into the high priest's house.  Peter followed at a distance; and when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together\, Peter sat among them.  Then a maid\, seeing him as he sat in the light and gazing at him\, said\, \"This man also was with him.\"  But he denied it\, saying \"Woman\, I do not know him.\"  And a little later someone else saw him and said\, \"You also are one of them.\"  But Peter said\, \"Man\, I am not.\"  And after an interval of about an hour still another insisted\, saying\, \"Certainly this man also was with him; for he is a Galilean.\"  But Peter said\, \"Man\, I do not know what you are saying.\"  And immediately\, while he was still speaking\, the cock crowed.  And the Lord turned and looked at Peter.  And Peter remembered the word of the Lord\, how he had said to him\, \"Before the cock crows today\, you will deny me three times.\"  And he went out and wept bitterly.\n\nNow the men who were holding Jesus mocked him and beat him; they also blindfolded him and asked him\, \"Prophesy!  Who is it that struck you?\"  And they spoke many other words against him\, reviling him.\n\nWhen day came\, the assembly of the elders of the people gathered together\, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away to their council\, and they said\, \"If you are the Christ\, tell us.\"  But he said to them\, \"If I tell you\, you will not believe; and if I ask you\, you will not answer.  But from now on the Son of man shall be seated at the right hand of the power of God.\"  And they all said\, \"Are you the Son of God\, then?\"  And he said to them\, \"You say that I am.\"  And they said\, \"What further testimony do we need?  We have heard it ourselves from his own lips.\"\n\nThen the whole company of them arose\, and brought him before Pilate.\n\n

SUMMARY:Porphyrius\, Bishop of Gaza
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 02/26/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Porphyrius\, Bishop of Gaza; The Holy Great Martyr Photine\, the Samaritan Women; Holy Martyr Theocletus; John Claphas the new Martyr\n\nFast Day (Dairy\, Eggs\, and Fish Allowed)\n\nOld Testament Reading: Joel 3:12-21\nLet the nations bestir themselves\, and come up to the valley of Jehosh'aphat; for there I will sit to judge all the nations round about.\n\nPut in the sickle\, for the harvest is ripe.  Go in\, tread\, for the wine press is full.  The vats overflow\, for their wickedness is great.\n\nMultitudes\, multitudes\, in the valley of decision!  For the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision.  The sun and the moon are darkened\, and the stars withdraw their shining.\n\nAnd the Lord roars from Zion\, and utters his voice from Jerusalem\, and the heavens and the earth shake.  But the Lord is a refuge to his people\, a stronghold to the people of Israel.\n\n\"So you shall know that I am the Lord your God\, who dwell in Zion\, my holy mountain.  And Jerusalem shall be holy and strangers shall never again pass through it.\n\n\"And in that day the mountains shall drip sweet wine\, and the hills shall flow with milk\, and all the stream beds of Judah shall flow with water; and a fountain shall come forth from the house of the Lord and water the valley of Shittim.\n\n\"Egypt shall become a desolation and Edom a desolate wilderness\, for the violence done to the people of Judah\, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.  But Judah shall be inhabited for ever\, and Jerusalem to all generations.  I will avenge their blood\, and I will not clear the guilty\, for the Lord dwells in Zion.\" \n\nOld Testament Reading: Joel 2:12-26\n\"Yet even now\,\" says the Lord\, \"return to me with all your heart\, with fasting\, with weeping\, and with mourning; and rend your hearts and not your garments.\"  Return to the Lord\, your God\, for he is gracious and merciful\, slow to anger\, and abounding in steadfast love\, and repents of evil.  Who knows whether he will not turn and repent\, and leave a blessing behind him\, a cereal offering and a drink offering for the Lord\, your God?\n\nBlow the trumpet in Zion; sanctify a fast; call a solemn assembly; gather the people.  Sanctify the congregation; assemble the elders; gather the children\, even nursing infants.  Let the bridegroom leave his room\, and the bride her chamber.\n\nBetween the vestibule and the altar let the priests\, the ministers of the Lord\, weep and say\, \"Spare thy people\, O Lord\, and make not thy heritage a reproach\, a byword among the nations.  Why should they say among the peoples\, 'Where is their God?'\"\n\nThen the Lord became jealous for his land\, and had pity on his people.  The Lord answered and said to his people\, \"Behold\, I am sending to you grain\, wine\, and oil\, and you will be satisfied; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.\n\n\"I will remove the northerner far from you\, and drive him into a parched and desolate land\, his front into the eastern sea\, and his rear into the western sea; the stench and foul smell of him will rise\, for he has done great things.\n\n\"Fear not\, O land; be glad and rejoice\, for the Lord has done great things!  Fear not\, you beasts of the field\, for the pastures of the wilderness are green; the tree bears its fruit\, the fig tree and vine give their full yield.\n\n\"Be glad\, O sons of Zion\, and rejoice in the Lord\, your God; for he has given the early rain for your vindication\, he has poured down for you abundant rain\, the early and the latter rain\, as before.\n\n\"The threshing floors shall be full of grain\, the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.  I will restore to you the years which the swarming locust has eaten\, the hopper\, the destroyer\, and the cutter\, my great army\, which I sent among you.\n\n\"You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied\, and praise the name of the Lord your God\, who has dealt wondrously with you.  And my people shall never again be put to shame.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Procopius the Confessor of Decapolis
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 02/27/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Procopius the Confessor of Decapolis; Ephraim of Katounakia; Raphael of Brooklyn; Stephen the Monk; Gelasios the Actor and Martyr of Heliopolis; Nesios the Martyr\n\nFast Day (Dairy\, Eggs\, and Fish Allowed)\n\nEpistle Reading: Jude 1:11-25\nBeloved\, woe to the ungodly\, for they walk in the way of Cain\, and abandon themselves for the sake of gain to Balaam's error\, and perish in Korah's rebellion.  These are blemishes on your love feasts\, as they boldly carouse together\, looking after themselves; waterless clouds\, carried along by winds; fruitless trees in late autumn\, twice dead\, uprooted; wild waves of the sea\, casting up the foam of their own shame; wandering stars for whom the nether gloom of darkness has been reserved for ever.\n\nIt was of these also that Enoch in the seventh generation from Adam prophesied\, saying\, \"Behold\, the Lord came with his holy myriads\, to execute judgment on all\, and to convict all the ungodly of all their deeds of ungodliness which they have committed in such an ungodly way\, and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.\"  These are grumblers\, malcontents\, following their own passions\, loud-mouthed boasters\, flattering people to gain advantage.\n\nBut you must remember\, beloved\, the predictions of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; they said to you\, \"In the last time there will be scoffers\, following their own ungodly passions.\"  It is these who set up divisions\, worldly people\, devoid of the Spirit.  But you\, beloved\, build yourselves up on your most holy faith; pray in the Holy Spirit; keep yourselves in the love of God; wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.  And convince some\, who doubt; save some\, by snatching them out of the fire; on some have mercy with fear\, hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.\n\nNow to him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you without blemish before the presence of his glory with rejoicing\, to the only God\, our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord\, be glory\, majesty\, dominion\, and authority\, before all time and now and for ever.  Amen.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 23:1-31\, 33\, 44-56\nAt that time\, the chief priests\, the scribes\, and elders of the people brought Jesus before Pilate.  And they began to accuse him\, saying\, \"We found this man perverting our nation\, and forbidding us to give tribute to Caesar\, and saying that he himself is Christ a king.\"  And Pilate asked him\, \"Are you the King of the Jews?\"  And he answered him\, \"You have said so.\"  And Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes\, \"I find no crime in this man.\"  But they were urgent\, saying\, \"He stirs up the people\, teaching throughout all Judea\, from Galilee even to this place.\"\n\nWhen Pilate heard this\, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.  And when he learned that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction\, he sent him over to Herod\, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time.  When Herod saw Jesus\, he was very glad\, for he had long desired to see him\, because he had heard about him\, and he was hoping to see some sign done by him.  So he questioned him at some length; but he made no answer.  The chief priests and the scribes stood by\, vehemently accusing him.  And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him; then\, arraying him in gorgeous apparel\, he sent him back to Pilate.  And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day\, for before this they had been at enmity with each other.\n\nPilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people\, and said to them\, \"You brought me this man as one who was perverting the people; and after examining him before you\, behold\, I did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him; neither did Herod\, for he sent him back to us.  Behold\, nothing deserving death has been done by him; I will therefore chastise him and release him.\" Now he was obliged to release one man to them at the festival.\n\nBut they all cried out together\, \"Away with this man\, and release to us Barabbas\" -- a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city\, and for murder.  Pilate addressed them once more\, desiring to release Jesus; but they shouted out\, \"Crucify\, crucify him!\"  A third time he said to them\, \"Why\, what evil has he done?  I have found in him no crime deserving death; I will therefore chastise him and release him.\"  But they were urgent\, demanding with loud cries that he should be crucified.  And their voices prevailed.  So Pilate gave sentence that their demand should be granted.  He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder\, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.\n\nAnd as they led him away\, they seized one Simon of Cyrene\, who was coming in from the country\, and laid on him the cross\, to carry it behind Jesus.  And there followed him a great multitude of the people\, and of women who bewailed and lamented him.  But Jesus turning to them said\, \"Daughters of Jerusalem\, do not weep for me\, but weep for yourselves and for your children.  For behold\, the days are coming when they will say\, 'Blessed are the barren\, and the wombs that never bore\, and the breasts that never gave suck!'  Then they will begin to say to the mountains\, 'Fall on us'; and to the hills\, 'Cover us.'  For if they do this when the wood is green\, what will happen when it is dry?\"\n\nAnd when they came to the place which is called The Skull\, there they crucified him\, and the criminals\, one on the right and one on the left.\n\nIt was now about the sixth hour\, and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour\, while the sun's light failed; and the curtain of the temple was torn in two.  Then Jesus\, crying with a loud voice\, said\, \"Father\, into your hands I commit my spirit!\"  And having said this he breathed his last.  Now when the centurion saw what had taken place\, he praised God\, and said\, \"Certainly this man was innocent!\"  And all the multitudes who assembled to see the sight\, when they saw what had taken place\, returned home beating their breasts.  And all his acquaintances and the women who had followed him from Galilee stood at a distance and saw these things.\n\nNow there was a man named Joseph from the Jewish town of Arimathea.  He was a member of the council\, a good and righteous man\, who had not consented to their purpose and deed\, and he was looking for the kingdom of God.  This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.  Then he took it down and wrapped it in a linen shroud\, and laid him in a rock hewn tomb\, where no one had ever yet been laid.  It was the day of Preparation\, and the sabbath was beginning.  The women who had come with him from Galilee followed\, and saw the tomb\, and how his body was laid; then they returned\, and prepared spices and ointments.\n\nOn the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.\n\n

For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for beast\, neither was there any safety from the foe for him who went out or came in; for I set every man against his fellow.  But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people as in the former days\, says the Lord of hosts.  For there shall be a sowing of peace; the vine shall yield its fruit\, and the ground shall give its increase\, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.  And as you have been a byword of cursing among the nations\, O house of Judah and house of Israel\, so will I save you and you shall be a blessing.  Fear not\, but let your hands be strong.\"\n\nFor thus says the Lord of hosts:  \"As I purposed to do evil to you\, when your fathers provoked me to wrath\, and I did not relent\, says the Lord of hosts\,  so again have I purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah; fear not.  These are the things that you shall do: Speak the truth to one another\, render in your gates judgments that are true and make for peace\, do not devise evil in your hearts against one another\, and love no false oath\, for all these things I hate\, says the Lord.\"\n\nOld Testament Reading: Zechariah 8:19-23\n\"Thus says the Lord of hosts:  The fast of the fourth month\, and the fast of the fifth\, and the fast of the seventh\, and the fast of the tenth\, shall be to the house of Judah seasons of joy and gladness\, and cheerful feasts; therefore love truth and peace.\n\n\"Thus says the Lord of hosts:  Peoples shall yet come\, even the inhabitants of many cities; the inhabitants of one city shall go to another\, saying\, 'Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the Lord\, and to seek the Lord of hosts; I am going.'  Many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem\, and to entreat the favor of the Lord.  Thus says the Lord of hosts:  In those days ten men from the nations of every tongue shall take hold of the robe of a Jew\, saying\, 'Let us go with you\, for we have heard that God is with you.'\"\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/01/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Cheesefare Saturday; The Holy Righteous Martyr Eudocia the Samaritan; Andonina the New Martyr; David the Archbishop\n\nFast Day (Dairy\, Eggs\, and Fish Allowed)\n\nEpistle Reading: Galatians 5:22-26;6:1-2\nBrethren\, the fruit of the Spirit is love\, joy\, peace\, patience\, kindness\, goodness\, faithfulness\, gentleness\, self-control; against such there is no law.  And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.  If we live by the Spirit\, let us also walk by the Spirit.  Let us have no self-conceit\, no provoking of one another\, no envy of one another.  Brethren\, if a man is overtaken in any trespass\, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness.  Look to yourself\, lest you too be tempted.  Bear one another's burdens\, and so fulfill the law of Christ.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 6:1-13\nThe Lord said\, \"Beware of practicing your piety before men in order to be seen by them; for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.\n\n\"Thus\, when you give alms\, sound no trumpet before you\, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets\, that they may be praised by men.  Truly\, I say to you\, they have received their reward.  But when you give alms\, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing\, so that your alms may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.\n\n\"And when you pray\, you must not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners\, that they may be seen by men.  Truly\, I say to you\, they have received their reward.  But when you pray\, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.\n\n\"And in praying do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think they will be heard for their many words.  Do not be like them\, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.  Pray then like this:\n\nOur Father who are in heaven\,\n Hallowed be your name\,\n Your kingdom come\,\n Your will be done\,\n On earth as it is in heaven.\n Give us this day our daily bread\,\n And forgive us our debts\,\n As we also have forgiven our debtors;\n And lead us not into temptation\,\n But deliver us from evil.\n For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory\, for ever.\n Amen.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Forgiveness Sunday
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/02/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Forgiveness Sunday; Hesychius the Martyr; Our Holy Father Nicholas Planas; Joachim of Vatopedi who was given the name Papoulakis; Andronikos & Athanasia the Martyrs; Theodotos the Holy Martyr\, Bishop of Cyrenia; Euthalia the Virgin-Martyr of Sicily; Chad\, Bishop of Lichfield\n\nFast Day (Dairy\, Eggs\, and Fish Allowed)\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Mark 16:9-20\nWhen Jesus rose early on the first day of the week\, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene\, from whom He had cast out seven demons. She went and told those who had been with Him\, as they mourned and wept. But when they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her\, they would not believe it.\n\nAfter this he appeared in another form to two of them\, as they were walking into the country. And they went back and told the rest\, but they did not believe them. After this He appeared to the eleven themselves as they sat at table and He upbraided them for their unbelief and hardness of heart\, because they had not believed those who saw Him after He had risen. And He said to them\, \"Go into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation. He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned. And these signs will accompany those who believe: in My name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents\, and if they drink any deadly thing\, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick\, and they will recover.\"\n\nSo then the Lord Jesus\, after He had spoken to them\, was taken up into heaven\, and sat down at the right hand of God. And they went forth and preached everywhere\, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that attended it. Amen.\n\nEpistle Reading: Romans 13:11-14;14:1-4\nBrethren\, salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed; the night is far gone\, the day is at hand.  Let us then cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light; let us conduct ourselves becomingly as in the day\, not in reveling and drunkenness\, not in debauchery and licentiousness\, not in quarreling and jealousy.  But put on the Lord Jesus Christ\, and make no provision for the flesh\, to gratify its desires.\n\nAs for the man who is weak in faith\, welcome him\, but not for disputes over opinions.  One believes he may eat anything\, while the weak man eats only vegetables.  Let not him who eats despise him who abstains\, and let not him who abstains pass judgment on him who eats; for God has welcomed him.  Who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another?  It is before his own master that he stands or falls.  And he will be upheld\, for God is able to make him stand. \n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 6:14-21\nThe Lord said\, \"If you forgive men their trespasses\, your heavenly Father also will forgive you; but if you do not forgive men their trespasses\, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.\n\n\"And when you fast\, do not look dismal\, like the hypocrites\, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by men.  Truly\, I say to you\, they have received their reward.  But when you fast\, anoint your head and wash your face\, that your fasting may not be seen by men but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.\n\n\"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth\, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal\, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven\, where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal.  For where your treasure is\, there will your heart be also.\"\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/03/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: The Holy Martyrs Eutropius\, Cleonicus\, and Basiliscus; Theodoretos the Holy Martyr of Antioch; Nonnita\, mother of Saint David\n\nStrict Fast\n\nOld Testament Reading: Isaiah 1:1-20\nThe vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz\, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzzi'ah\, Jotham\, Ahaz\, and Hezeki'ah\, kings of Judah.  Hear\, O heavens\, and give ear\, O earth; for the Lord has spoken:  \"Sons have I reared and brought up\, but they have rebelled against me.  The ox knows its owner\, and the ass its master's crib; but Israel does not know\, my people does not understand.\"\n\nAh\, sinful nation\, a people laden with iniquity\, offspring of evildoers\, sons who deal corruptly!  They have forsaken the Lord\, they have despised the Holy One of Israel\, they are utterly estranged.\n\nWhy will you still be smitten\, that you continue to rebel?  The whole head is sick\, and the whole heart faint.  From the sole of the foot even to the head\, there is no soundness in it\, but bruises and sores and bleeding wounds; they are not pressed out\, or bound up\, or softened with oil.\n\nYour country lies desolate\, your cities are burned with fire; in your very presence aliens devour your land; it is desolate\, as overthrown by aliens.  And the daughter of Zion is left like a booth in a vineyard\, like a lodge in a cucumber field\, like a besieged city.\n\nIf the Lord of hosts had not left us a few survivors\, we should have been like Sodom\, and become like Gomor'rah.\n\nHear the word of the Lord\, you rulers of Sodom!  Give ear to the teaching of our God\, you people of Gomor'rah!  \"What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? says the Lord; I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts; I do not delight in the blood of bulls\, or of lambs\, or of he-goats.\n\n\"When you come to appear before me\, who requires of you this trampling of my courts?  Bring no more vain offerings; incense is an abomination to me.  New moon and sabbath and the calling of assemblies -- I cannot endure iniquity and solemn assembly.  Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates; they have become a burden to me\, I am weary of bearing them.  When you spread forth your hands\, I will hide my eyes from you; even though you make many prayers\, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood.  Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil\, learn to do good; seek justice\, correct oppression; defend the fatherless\, plead for the widow.\n\n\"Come now\, let us reason together\, says the Lord:  though your sins are like scarlet\, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson\, they shall become like wool.  If you are willing and obedient\, you shall eat the good of the land; But if you refuse and rebel\, you shall be devoured by the sword; for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.\"\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 1:1-13\nIn the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.  The earth was without form and void\, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the Spirit of God was moving over the face of the waters.\n\nAnd God said\, \"Let there be light\"; and there was light.  And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness.  God called the light Day\, and the darkness he called Night.  And there was evening and there was morning\, one day.\n\nAnd God said\, \"Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters\, and let it separate the waters from the waters.\"  And God made the firmament and separated the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament.  And it was so.  And God called the firmament Heaven.  And there was evening and there was morning\, a second day.\n\nAnd God said\, \"Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place\, and let the dry land appear.\"  And it was so.  God called the dry land Earth\, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas.  And God saw that it was good.  And God said\, \"Let the earth put forth vegetation\, plants yielding seed\, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed\, each according to its kind\, upon the earth.\"  And it was so.  The earth brought forth vegetation\, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds\, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed\, each according to its kind.  And God saw that it was good.  And there was evening and there was morning\, a third day.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 1:1-20\nThe proverbs of Solomon\, son of David\, king of Israel:\n\nThat men may know wisdom and instruction\, understand words of insight\, receive instruction in wise dealing\, righteousness\, justice\, and equity; that prudence may be given to the simple\, knowledge and discretion to the youth -- the wise man also may hear and increase in learning\, and the man of understanding acquire skill\, to understand a proverb and a figure\, the words of the wise and their riddles.  The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.\n\nHear\, my son\, your father's instruction\, and reject not your mother's teaching; for they are a fair garland for your head\, and pendants for your neck.  My son\, if sinners entice you\, do not consent.  If they say\, \"Come with us\, let us lie in wait for blood\, let us wantonly ambush the innocent; like Sheol let us swallow them alive and whole\, like those who go down to the Pit; we shall find all precious goods\, we shall fill our houses with spoil; throw in your lot among us\, we will all have one purse\" -- my son\, do not walk in the way with them\, hold back your foot from their paths; for their feet run to evil\, and they make haste to shed blood.  For in vain is a net spread in the sight of any bird; but these men lie in wait for their own blood\, they set an ambush for their own lives.  Such are the ways of all who get gain by violence; it takes away the life of its possessors.\n\nWisdom cries aloud in the street; in the markets she raises her voice.\n\n

Righteousness lodged in her\, but now murderers.  Your silver has become dross\, your wine mixed with water.  Your princes are rebels and companions of thieves.  Every one loves a bribe and runs after gifts.  They do not defend the fatherless\, and the widow's cause does not come to them.\n\nTherefore the Lord says\, the Lord of hosts\, the Mighty One of Israel:  \"Ah\, I will vent my wrath on my enemies\, and avenge myself on my foes.  I will turn my hand against you and will smelt away your dross as with lye and remove all your alloy.  And I will restore your judges as at the first\, and your counselors as at the beginning.  Afterward you shall be called the city of righteousness\, the faithful city.\"\n\nZion shall be redeemed by justice\, and those in her who repent\, by righteousness.  But rebels and sinners shall be destroyed together\, and those who forsake the Lord shall be consumed.  For you shall be ashamed of the oaks in which you delighted; and you shall blush for the gardens which you have chosen.  For you shall be like an oak whose leaf withers\, and like a garden without water.  And the strong shall become tow\, and his work a spark\, and both of them shall burn together\, with none to quench them.\n\nThe word which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.  It shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established as the highest of the mountains\, and shall be raised above the hills; and all the nations shall flow to it\, and many peoples shall come\, and say:  \"Come\, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord\, to the house of the God of Jacob; that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths.\"  For out of Zion shall go forth the law\, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 1:14-23\n And God said\, \"Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years\, and let them be lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth.\"  And it was so.  And God made the two great lights\, the greater light to rule the day\, and the lesser light to rule the night; he made the stars also.  And God set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth\, to rule over the day and over the night\, and to separate the light from the darkness.  And God saw that it was good.  And there was evening and there was morning\, a fourth day.\n\nAnd God said\, \"Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures\, and let birds fly above the earth across the firmament of the heavens.\"  So God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves\, with which the waters swarm\, according to their kinds\, and every winged bird according to its kind.  And God saw that it was good.  And God blessed them\, saying\, \"Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas\, and let birds multiply on the earth.\"  And there was evening and there was morning\, a fifth day.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 1:20-33\nWisdom cries aloud in the street; in the markets she raises her voice; on the top of the walls she cries out; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks:  \"How long\, O simple ones\, will you love being simple?  How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools hate knowledge? \n\n Give heed to my reproof; behold\, I will pour out my thoughts to you; I will make my words known to you.\n\n  Because I have called and you refused to listen\, have stretched out my hand and no one has heeded\, and you have ignored all my counsel and would have none of my reproof\, I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when panic strikes you\, when panic strikes you like a storm\, and your calamity comes like a whirlwind\, when distress and anguish come upon you. \n\nThen they will call upon me\, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently but will not find me.\n\n  Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord\, would have none of my counsel\, and despised all my reproof\, therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way and be sated with their own devices.\n\n  For the simple are killed by their turning away\, and the complacence of fools destroys them; but he who listens to me will dwell secure and will be at ease\, without dread of evil.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Conon the Gardener
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/05/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Conon the Gardener; Parthenios the New Martyr who contested in Didymoteichos; Mark the Ascetic; Righteous Father Mark of Athens; John the Bulgarian; Mark the Faster; George the New-Martyr of Rapsani; Eulogios the Martyr; Eulabios the Martyr; Conon the Isaurian; Archelaos the Martyr of Egypt\n\nStrict Fast\n\nOld Testament Reading: Isaiah 2:3-11\nThus say the people:  \"Come\, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord\, to the house of the God of Jacob; that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths.\"  For out of Zion shall go forth the law\, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.  He shall judge between the nations\, and shall decide for many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares\, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation\, neither shall they learn war any more.\n\nO house of Jacob\, come\, let us walk in the light of the Lord.\n\nFor thou hast rejected thy people\, the house of Jacob\, because they are full of diviners from the east and of soothsayers like the Philistines\, and they strike hands with foreigners.  Their land is filled with silver and gold\, and there is no end to their treasures; their land is filled with horses\, and there is no end to their chariots.  Their land is filled with idols; they bow down to the work of their hands\, to what their own fingers have made.  So man is humbled\, and men are brought low -- forgive them not!  Enter into the rock\, and hide in the dust from before the terror of the Lord\, and from the glory of his majesty.  The haughty looks of man shall be brought low\, and the pride of men shall be humbled; and the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 1:24-2:3\n And God said\, \"Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds:  cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.\"  And it was so.  And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the cattle according to their kinds\, and everything that creeps upon the ground according to its kind.  And God saw that it was good.\n\nThen God said\, \"Let us make man in our image\, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea\, and over the birds of the air\, and over the cattle\, and over all the earth\, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.\"  So God created man in his own image\, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.  And God blessed them\, and God said to them\, \"Be fruitful and multiply\, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.\"  And God said\, \"Behold\, I have given you every plant yielding seed which is upon the face of all the earth\, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food.  And to every beast of the earth\, and to every bird of the air\, and to everything that creeps on the earth\, everything that has the breath of life\, I have given every green plant for food.\"  And it was so.  And God saw everything that he had made\, and behold\, it was very good.  And there was evening and there was morning\, a sixth day.\n\nThus the heavens and the earth were finished\, and all the host of them.  And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had done\, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.  So God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it\, because on it God rested from all his work which he had done in creation.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 2:1-22\nMy son\, if you receive my words and treasure up my commandments with you\, making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to understanding; yes\, if you cry out for insight and raise your voice for understanding\, if you seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures; then you will understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God.  For the Lord gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding; he stores up sound wisdom for the upright; he is a shield to those who walk in integrity\, guarding the paths of justice and preserving the way of his saints.  Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity\, every good path; for wisdom will come into your heart\, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul; discretion will watch over you; understanding will guard you; delivering you from the way of evil\, from men of perverted speech\, who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness\, who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perverseness of evil; men whose paths are crooked\, and who are devious in their ways.\n\nYou will be saved from the loose woman\, from the adventuress with her smooth words\, who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God; for her house sinks down to death\, and her paths to the shades; none who go to her come back nor do they regain the paths of life.\n\nSo you will walk in the way of good men and keep to the paths of the righteous.  For the upright will inhabit the land\, and men of integrity will remain in it; but the wicked will be cut off from the land\, and the treacherous will be rooted out of it.\n\n

SUMMARY:42 Martyrs of Amorion in Phrygia
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/06/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: 42 Martyrs of Amorion in Phrygia; Finding the Precious Cross by St. Helen; Hesychios the Wonderworker\n\nStrict Fast\n\nOld Testament Reading: Isaiah 2:11-21\nThe haughty looks of man shall be brought low\, and the pride of men shall be humbled; and the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.\n\nFor the Lord of hosts has a day against all that is proud and lofty\, against all that is lifted up and high; against all the cedars of Lebanon\, lofty and lifted up; and against all the oaks of Bashan; against all the high mountains\, and against all the lofty hills; against every high tower\, and against every fortified wall; against all the ships of Tarshish\, and against all the beautiful craft.  And the haughtiness of man shall be humbled\, and the pride of men shall be brought low; and the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.  And the idols shall utterly pass away.  And men shall enter the caves of the rocks and the holes of the ground\, from before the terror of the Lord\, and from the glory of his majesty\, when he rises to terrify the earth.\n\nIn that day men will cast forth their idols of silver and their idols of gold\, which they made for themselves to worship\, to the moles and to the bats\, to enter the caverns of the rocks and the clefts of the cliffs\, from before the terror of the Lord\, and from the glory of his majesty\, when he rises to terrify the earth.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 2:4-19\nThese are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created.\n\nIn the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens\, when no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung up -- for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth\, and there was no man to till the ground; but a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground -- then the Lord God formed man of dust from the ground\, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.  And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden\, in the east; and there he put the man whom he had formed.  And out of the ground the Lord God made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food\, the tree of life also in the midst of the garden\, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\n\nA river flowed out of Eden to water the garden\, and there it divided and became four rivers.  The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one which flows around the whole land of Hav'ilah\, where there is gold; and the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there.  The name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one which flows around the whole land of Cush.  And the name of the third river is Tigris\, which flows east of Assyria.  And the fourth river is the Euphra'tes.\n\nThe Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till it and keep it.  And the Lord God commanded the man\, saying\, \"You may freely eat of every tree of the garden; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat\, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die.\"\n\nThen the Lord God said\, \"It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.\"  So out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air\, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called every living creature\, that was its name.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 3:1-18\nMy son\, do not forget my teaching\, but let your heart keep my commandments; for length of days and years of life and abundant welfare will they give you.\n\nLet not loyalty and faithfulness forsake you; bind them about your neck\, write them on the tablet of your heart.  So you will find favor and good repute in the sight of God and man.\n\nTrust in the Lord with all your heart\, and do not rely on your own insight.  In all your ways acknowledge him\, and he will make straight your paths.  Be not wise in your own eyes; fear the Lord\, and turn away from evil.  It will be healing to your flesh and refreshment to your bones.\n\nHonor the Lord with your substance and with the first fruits of all your produce; then your barns will be filled with plenty\, and your vats will be bursting with wine.\n\nMy son\, do not despise the Lord's discipline or be weary of his reproof\, for the Lord reproves him whom he loves\, as a father the son in whom he delights.\n\nHappy is the man who finds wisdom\, and the man who gets understanding\, for the gain from it is better than gain from silver and its profit better than gold.  She is more precious than jewels\, and nothing you desire can compare with her.  Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.  Her ways are ways of pleasantness\, and all her paths are peace.  She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her; those who hold her fast are called happy.\n\n

SUMMARY:The Holy Martyred Bishops of Cherson: Basileus\, Ephraim\, Eugene\, Capito\, Aetherius\, Agathodorus\, and Elpidius
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/07/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: The Holy Martyred Bishops of Cherson: Basileus\, Ephraim\, Eugene\, Capito\, Aetherius\, Agathodorus\, and Elpidius; Lavrentios of Megara\, the Righteous; Paul the Simple\n\nStrict Fast\n\nOld Testament Reading: Isaiah 3:1-14\n For\, behold\, the Lord\, the Lord of hosts\, is taking away from Jerusalem and from Judah stay and staff\, the whole stay of bread\, and the whole stay of water; the mighty man and the soldier\, the judge and the prophet\, the diviner and the elder\, the captain of fifty and the man of rank\, the counselor and the skillful magician and the expert in charms.  And I will make boys their princes\, and babes shall rule over them.  And the people will oppress one another\, every man his fellow and every man his neighbor; the youth will be insolent to the elder\, and the base fellow to the honorable.\n\nWhen a man takes hold of his brother in the house of his father\, saying:  \"You have a mantle; you shall be our leader\, and this heap of ruins shall be under your rule\"; in that day he will speak out\, saying:  \"I will not be a healer; in my house there is neither bread nor mantle; you shall not make me leader of the people.\"  For Jerusalem has stumbled\, and Judah has fallen; because their speech and their deeds are against the Lord\, defying his glorious presence.\n\nTheir partiality witnesses against them; they proclaim their sin like Sodom\, they do not hide it.  Woe to them!  For they have brought evil upon themselves.  Tell the righteous that it shall be well with them\, for they shall eat the fruit of their deeds.  Woe to the wicked!  It shall be ill with him\, for what his hands have done shall be done to him.  My people -- children are their oppressors\, and women rule over them.  O my people\, your leaders mislead you\, and confuse the course of your paths.\n\nThe Lord has taken his place to contend\, he stands to judge his people.  The Lord enters into judgment with the elders and princes of his people:  \"It is you who have devoured the vineyard\, the spoil of the poor is in your houses.\"\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 2:20-3:20\n The man gave names to all cattle\, and to the birds of the air\, and to every beast of the field; but for the man there was not found a helper fit for him.  So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man\, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh; and the rib which the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.  Then the man said\, \"This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman\, because she was taken out of Man.\"  Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and cleaves to his wife\, and they become one flesh.  And the man and his wife were both naked\, and were not ashamed.\n\nNow the serpent was more subtle than any other wild creature that the Lord God had made.  He said to the woman\, \"Did God say\, 'You shall not eat of any tree of the garden'?\"  And the woman said to the serpent\, \"We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden; but God said\, 'You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden\, neither shall you touch it\, lest you die.'\"  But the serpent said to the woman\, \"You will not die.  For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened\, and you will be like God\, knowing good and evil.\"  So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food\, and that it was a delight to the eyes\, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise\, she took of its fruit and ate; and she also gave some to her husband\, and he ate.  Then the eyes of both were opened\, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons.\n\nAnd they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day\, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden.  But the Lord God called to the man\, and said to him\, \"Where are you?\"  And he said\, \"I heard the sound of thee in the garden\, and I was afraid\, because I was naked; and I hid myself.\"  He said\, \"Who told you that you were naked?  Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?\"  The man said\, \"The woman whom thou gavest to be with me\, she gave me fruit of the tree\, and I ate.\"  Then the Lord God said to the woman\, \"What is this that you have done?\"  The woman said\, \"The serpent beguiled me\, and I ate.\"  The Lord God said to the serpent\, \"Because you have done this\, cursed are you above all cattle\, and above all wild animals; upon your belly you shall go\, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.  I will put enmity between you and the woman\, and between your seed and her seed; he shall bruise your head\, and you shall bruise his heel.\"  To the woman he said\, \"I will greatly multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children\, yet your desire shall be for your husband\, and he shall rule over you.\"  And to Adam he said\, \"Because you have listened to the voice of your wife\, and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you\, 'You shall not eat of it\,' cursed is the ground because of you; in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life; thorns and thistles it shall bring forth to you; and you shall eat the plants of the field.  In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to the ground\, for out of it you were taken; you are dust\, and to dust you shall return.\"\n\nThe man called his wife's name Eve\, because she was the mother of all living.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 3:19-34\nThe Lord by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens; by his knowledge the deeps broke forth\, and the clouds drop down the dew.\n\nMy son\, keep sound wisdom and discretion; let them not escape from your sight\, and they will be life for your soul and adornment for your neck.  Then you will walk on your way securely and your foot will not stumble.  If you sit down\, you will not be afraid; when you lie down\, your sleep will be sweet.  Do not be afraid of sudden panic\, or of the ruin of the wicked\, when it comes; for the Lord will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being caught.  Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due\, when it is in your power to do it.\n\nDo not say to your neighbor\, \"Go\, and come again\, tomorrow I will give it\" -- when you have it with you.  Do not plan evil against your neighbor who dwells trustingly beside you.  Do not contend with a man for no reason\, when he has done you no harm.  Do not envy a man of violence and do not choose any of his ways; for the perverse man is an abomination to the Lord\, but the upright are in his confidence.  The Lord's curse is on the house of the wicked\, but he blesses the abode of the righteous.  Toward the scorners he is scornful\, but to the humble he shows favor.\n\n

SUMMARY:First Saturday of Lent: The Commemoration of the Miracle of Kollyva wrought by Saint Theodore the Tyro
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/08/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: First Saturday of Lent: The Commemoration of the Miracle of Kollyva wrought by Saint Theodore the Tyro; Theophylact the Confessor\, Bishop of Nicomedia; Hermas the Apostle of the 70; Dometios the Righteous; Paul the Confessor; Felix of Burgundy\, Enlightener of East Anglia\n\nFast Day (Wine and Oil Allowed)\n\nEpistle Reading: II Timothy 2:1-10\nTimothy\, my son\, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus\, and what you have heard from me before many witnesses entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also. Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. No soldier on service gets entangled in civilian pursuits\, since his aim is to satisfy the one who enlisted him. An athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. It is the hardworking farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops. Think over what I say\, for the Lord will grant you understanding in everything.\n\nRemember Jesus Christ\, risen from the dead\, descended from David\, as preached in my gospel\, the gospel for which I am suffering and wearing fetters like a criminal. But the word of God is not fettered. Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect\, that they also may obtain salvation in Christ Jesus with its eternal glory.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 2:23-28; 3:1-5\nAt that time\, Jesus was going through the grainfields; and as they made their way his disciples began to pluck heads of grain.  And the Pharisees said to him\, \"Look\, why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?\"  And he said to them\, \"Have you never read what David did\, when he was in need and was hungry\, he and those who were with him: how he entered the house of God\, when Abiathar was high priest\, and ate the bread of the Presence\, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat\, and also gave it to those who were with him?\"  And he said to them\, \"The sabbath was made for man\, not man for the sabbath; so the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath.\"\n\nAgain he entered the synagogue\, and a man was there who had a withered hand.  And they watched him\, to see whether he would heal him on the sabbath\, so that they might accuse him.  And he said to the man who had the withered hand\, \"Come here.\"  And he said to them\, \"Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do harm\, to save life or to kill?\"  But they were silent.  And he looked around at them with anger\, grieved at their hardness of heart\, and said to the man\, \"Stretch it out\,\" and his hand was restored.\n\n

SUMMARY:Sunday of Orthodoxy
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/09/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Sunday of Orthodoxy; The Holy Forty Martyrs of Sebastia; Caesarios the Righteous\n\nFast Day (Wine and Oil Allowed)\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Luke 24:1-12\nOn the first day of the week at early dawn\, the women went to the tomb\, taking spices\, which they had prepared. And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb\, but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. While they were perplexed about this\, behold\, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel; and as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground\, the men said to them\, \"Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here\, but has risen. Remember how He told you\, while He was still in Galilee\, that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men\, and be crucified\, and on the third day rise.\" And they remembered His words and returning from the tomb they told all this to the eleven and to all the rest. Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told this to the Apostles; but these words seemed to them an idle tale\, and they did not believe them. But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in\, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home wondering at what had happened.\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 12:1-10\nBRETHREN\, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses\, let us also lay aside every weight\, and sin which clings so closely\, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us\, looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith\, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross\, despising the shame\, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God. Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself\, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted. In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. And have you forgotten the exhortation which addresses you as sons? \"My son\, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord\, nor lose courage when you are punished by him. For the Lord disciplines him whom he loves\, and chastises every son whom he receives.\" It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline? If you are left without discipline\, in which all have participated\, then you are illegitimate children and not sons. Besides this\, we have had earthly fathers to discipline us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father.\n\nGospel Reading: John 1:43-51\nAt that time\, Jesus decided to go to Galilee.  And he found Philip and said to him\, \"Follow me.\"  Now Philip was from Bethsaida\, the city of Andrew and Peter.  Philip found Nathanael\, and he said to him\, \"We have found him of whom Moses in the law and also the prophets wrote\, Jesus of Nazareth\, the son of Joseph.\"  Nathanael said to him\, \"Can anything good come out of Nazareth?\"  Philip said to him\, \"Come and see.\"  Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him\, and said of him\, \"Behold\, an Israelite indeed\, in whom is no guile!\"  Nathanael said to him\, \"How do you know me?\"  Jesus answered him\, \"Before Philip called you\, when you were under the fig tree\, I saw you.\"  Nathanael answered him\, \"Rabbi\, you are the Son of God!  You are the King of Israel!\"  Jesus answered him\, \"Because I said to you\, I saw you under the fig tree\, do you believe?  You shall see greater things than these.\"  And he said to him\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, you will see heaven opened\, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Quadratus the Martyr & his Companions
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/10/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Quadratus the Martyr & his Companions; Anastasia of Alexandria; Michael Mauroudes the New-Martyr \n\nStrict Fast\n\nOld Testament Reading: Isaiah 4:2-5:7\nIn that day the branch of the LORD shall be beautiful and glorious\, and the fruit of the land shall be the pride and glory of the survivors of Israel.  And he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy\, every one who has been recorded for life in Jerusalem\, when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and cleansed the bloodstains of Jerusalem from its midst by a spirit of judgment and by a spirit of burning.  Then the LORD will create over the whole site of Mount Zion and over her assemblies a cloud by day\, and smoke and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory there will be a canopy and a pavilion.  It will be for a shade by day from the heat\, and for a refuge and a shelter from the storm and rain.  Let me sing for my beloved a love song concerning his vineyard: My beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill.  He digged it and cleared it of stones\, and planted it with choice vines; he built a watchtower in the midst of it\, and hewed out a wine vat in it; and he looked for it to yield grapes\, but it yielded wild grapes.  And now\, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah\, judge\, I pray you\, between me and my vineyard.  What more was there to do for my vineyard\, that I have not done in it? When I looked for it to yield grapes\, why did it yield wild grapes?  And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard. I will remove its hedge\, and it shall be devoured; I will break down its wall\, and it shall be trampled down.  I will make it a waste; it shall not be pruned or hoed\, and briers and thorns shall grow up; I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.  For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel\, and the men of Judah are his pleasant planting; and he looked for justice\, but behold\, bloodshed; for righteousness\, but behold\, a cry!\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 3:21-4:7\n And the LORD God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins\, and clothed them.  Then the LORD God said\, \"Behold\, the man has become like one of us\, knowing good and evil; and now\, lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life\, and eat\, and live for ever\"- therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden\, to till the ground from which he was taken.  He drove out the man; and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim\, and a flaming sword which turned every way\, to guard the way to the tree of life.  \n\n Now Adam knew Eve his wife\, and she conceived and bore Cain\, saying\, \"I have gotten a man with the help of the LORD.\"  And again\, she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep\, and Cain a tiller of the ground.  In the course of time Cain brought to the LORD an offering of the fruit of the ground\, and Abel brought of the firstlings of his flock and of their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and his offering\, but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry\, and his countenance fell.  The LORD said to Cain\, \"Why are you angry\, and why has your countenance fallen?  If you do well\, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well\, sin is couching at the door; its desire is for you\, but you must master it.\"\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 3:34-4:22\nToward the scorners he is scornful\, but to the humble he shows favor.  The wise will inherit honor\, but fools get disgrace.\n\n  Hear\, O sons\, a father's instruction\, and be attentive\, that you may gain insight; for I give you good precepts: do not forsake my teaching.  When I was a son with my father\, tender\, the only one in the sight of my mother\, he taught me\, and said to me\, \"Let your heart hold fast my words; keep my commandments\, and live; do not forget\, and do not turn away from the words of my mouth. Get wisdom; get insight.  Do not forsake her\, and she will keep you; love her\, and she will guard you.  The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom\, and whatever you get\, get insight.  Prize her highly\, and she will exalt you; she will honor you if you embrace her.  She will place on your head a fair garland; she will bestow on you a beautiful crown.\"\n\n  Hear\, my son\, and accept my words\, that the years of your life may be many.  I have taught you the way of wisdom; I have led you in the paths of uprightness.  When you walk\, your step will not be hampered; and if you run\, you will not stumble.  Keep hold of instruction\, do not let go; guard her\, for she is your life.  Do not enter the path of the wicked\, and do not walk in the way of evil men.  Avoid it; do not go on it; turn away from it and pass on.  For they cannot sleep unless they have done wrong; they are robbed of sleep unless they have made some one stumble.  For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.  But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn\, which shines brighter and brighter until full day.  The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know over what they stumble.\n\n  My son\, be attentive to my words; incline your ear to my sayings.  Let them not escape from your sight; keep them within your heart.\n\n

SUMMARY:Sophronius\, Patriarch of Jerusalem
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/11/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Sophronius\, Patriarch of Jerusalem; Theodora the Righteous; Pionios the Presbyter; George the New Wonderworker of Constantinople; Trophimos and Thallos the Martyrs\n\nStrict Fast\n\nOld Testament Reading: Isaiah 5:7-16\nThus says the Lord: For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel\, and the men of Judah are his pleasant planting; and he looked for justice\, but behold\, bloodshed; for righteousness\, but behold\, a cry!  Woe to those who join house to house\, who add field to field\, until there is no more room\, and you are made to dwell alone in the midst of the land.  The LORD of hosts has sworn in my hearing: \"Surely many houses shall be desolate\, large and beautiful houses\, without inhabitant.  For ten acres of vineyard shall yield but one bath\, and a homer of seed shall yield but an ephah.\"  Woe to those who rise early in the morning\, that they may run after strong drink\, who tarry late into the evening till wine inflames them!  They have lyre and harp\, timbrel and flute and wine at their feasts; but they do not regard the deeds of the LORD\, or see the work of his hands.  Therefore my people go into exile for want of knowledge; their honored men are dying of hunger\, and their multitude is parched with thirst.  Therefore Sheol has enlarged its appetite and opened its mouth beyond measure\, and the nobility of Jerusalem and her multitude go down\, her throng and he who exults in her.  Man is bowed down\, and men are brought low\, and the eyes of the haughty are humbled.  But the LORD of hosts is exalted in justice\, and the Holy God shows himself holy in righteousness.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 4:8-15\n Cain said to Abel his brother\, \"Let us go out to the field.\" And when they were in the field\, Cain rose up against his brother Abel\, and killed him.  Then the LORD said to Cain\, \"Where is Abel your brother?\" He said\, \"I do not know; am I my brother's keeper?\"  And the LORD said\, \"What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying to me from the ground.  And now you are cursed from the ground\, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.  When you till the ground\, it shall no longer yield to you its strength; you shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.\"  Cain said to the LORD\, \"My punishment is greater than I can bear.  Behold\, thou hast driven me this day away from the ground; and from thy face I shall be hidden; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth\, and whoever finds me will slay me.\"  Then the LORD said to him\, \"Not so! If any one slays Cain\, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.\" And the LORD put a mark on Cain\, lest any who came upon him should kill him.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 5:1-15\nMy son\, be attentive to my wisdom\, incline your ear to my understanding; that you may keep discretion\, and your lips may guard knowledge.  For the lips of a loose woman drip honey\, and her speech is smoother than oil; but in the end she is bitter as wormwood\, sharp as a two-edged sword.  Her feet go down to death; her steps follow the path to Sheol; she does not take heed to the path of life; her ways wander\, and she does not know it.\n\n  And now\, O sons\, listen to me\, and do not depart from the words of my mouth.  Keep your way far from her\, and do not go near the door of her house; lest you give your honor to others and your years to the merciless; lest strangers take their fill of your strength\, and your labors go to the house of an alien; and at the end of your life you groan\, when your flesh and body are consumed\, and you say\, \"How I hated discipline\, and my heart despised reproof!  I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my instructors.  I was at the point of utter ruin in the assembled congregation.\"  Drink water from your own cistern\, flowing water from your own well.\n\n

SUMMARY:Theophanes the Confessor
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/12/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Theophanes the Confessor; Symeon the New Theologian; Gregory Dialogos\, Bishop of Rome; Phineas\, grandson of Prophet Aaron; Paul Aurelian\, Bishop of Brittany\n\nStrict Fast\n\nOld Testament Reading: Isaiah 5:16-25\nBut the LORD of hosts is exalted in justice\, and the Holy God shows himself holy in righteousness.  Then shall the lambs graze as in their pasture\, fatlings and kids shall feed among the ruins.  Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood\, who draw sin as with cart ropes\, who say: \"Let him make haste\, let him speed his work that we may see it; let the purpose of the Holy One of Israel draw near\, and let it come\, that we may know it!\"  Woe to those who call evil good and good evil\, who put darkness for light and light for darkness\, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!  Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes\, and shrewd in their own sight!  Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine\, and valiant men in mixing strong drink\, who acquit the guilty for a bribe\, and deprive the innocent of his right!  Therefore\, as the tongue of fire devours the stubble\, and as dry grass sinks down in the flame\, so their root will be as rottenness\, and their blossom go up like dust; for they have rejected the law of the LORD of hosts\, and have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.  Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against his people\, and he stretched out his hand against them and smote them\, and the mountains quaked; and their corpses were as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away and his hand is stretched out still.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 4:16-26\n Then Cain went away from the presence of the LORD\, and dwelt in the land of Nod\, east of Eden.  Cain knew his wife\, and she conceived and bore Enoch; and he built a city\, and called the name of the city after the name of his son\, Enoch.  To Enoch was born Irad; and Irad was the father of Mehujael\, and Mehujael the father of Methushael\, and Methushael the father of Lamech.  And Lamech took two wives; the name of the one was Adah\, and the name of the other Zillah.  Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have cattle.  His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe.  Zillah bore Tubalcain; he was the forger of all instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.  Lamech said to his wives: \"Adah and Zillah\, hear my voice; you wives of Lamech\, hearken to what I say: I have slain a man for wounding me\, a young man for striking me.  If Cain is avenged sevenfold\, truly Lamech seventy-sevenfold.\" \n\n  And Adam knew his wife again\, and she bore a son and called his name Seth\, for she said\, \"God has appointed for me another child instead of Abel\, for Cain slew him.\"  To Seth also a son was born\, and he called his name Enosh. At that time men began to call upon the name of the LORD.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 5:15-6:3\nDrink water from your own cistern\, flowing water from your own well.  Should your springs be scattered abroad\, streams of water in the streets?  Let them be for yourself alone\, and not for strangers with you.  Let your fountain be blessed\, and rejoice in the wife of your youth\, a lovely hind\, a graceful doe. Let her affection fill you at all times with delight\, be infatuated always with her love.  Why should you be infatuated\, my son\, with a loose woman and embrace the bosom of an adventuress?  For a man's ways are before the eyes of the LORD\, and he watches all his paths.  The iniquities of the wicked ensnare him\, and he is caught in the toils of his sin.  He dies for lack of discipline\, and because of his great folly he is lost.\n\n  My son\, if you have become surety for your neighbor\, have given your pledge for a stranger; if you are snared in the utterance of your lips\, caught in the words of your mouth; then do this\, my son\, and save yourself\, for you have come into your neighbor's power: go\, hasten\, and importune your neighbor.\n\n

SUMMARY:Removal of the relics of Nicephorus\, Patriarch of Constantinople
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/13/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Removal of the relics of Nicephorus\, Patriarch of Constantinople; Pouplios the Martyr\, Bishop of Athens; Christina the Martyr of Persia; Gerald\, Bishop of Mayo\n\nStrict Fast\n\nOld Testament Reading: Isaiah 6:1-12\nIn the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne\, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.  Above him stood the seraphim; each had six wings: with two he covered his face\, and with two he covered his feet\, and with two he flew.  And one called to another and said: \"Holy\, holy\, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.\"  And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called\, and the house was filled with smoke.  And I said: \"Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips\, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King\, the LORD of hosts!\"  Then flew one of the seraphim to me\, having in his hand a burning coal which he had taken with tongs from the altar.  And he touched my mouth\, and said: \"Behold\, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away\, and your sin forgiven.\"  And I heard the voice of the Lord saying\, \"Whom shall I send\, and who will go for us?\" Then I said\, \"Here am I! Send me.\"  And he said\, \"Go\, and say to this people: 'Hear and hear\, but do not understand; see and see\, but do not perceive.'  Make the heart of this people fat\, and their ears heavy\, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes\, and hear with their ears\, and understand with their hearts\, and turn and be healed.\"  Then I said\, \"How long\, O Lord?\" And he said: \"Until cities lie waste without inhabitant\, and houses without men\, and the land is utterly desolate\, and the LORD removes men far away\, and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.\"\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 5:1-24\n This is the book of the generations of Adam. When God created man\, he made him in the likeness of God.  Male and female he created them\, and he blessed them and named them Man when they were created.  When Adam had lived a hundred and thirty years\, he became the father of a son in his own likeness\, after his image\, and named him Seth.  The days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years; and he had other sons and daughters.  Thus all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years; and he died.  \n\n When Seth had lived a hundred and five years\, he became the father of Enosh.  Seth lived after the birth of Enosh eight hundred and seven years\, and had other sons and daughters.  Thus all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years; and he died.  \n\n When Enosh had lived ninety years\, he became the father of Kenan.  Enosh lived after the birth of Kenan eight hundred and fifteen years\, and had other sons and daughters.  Thus all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years; and he died.  \n\n When Kenan had lived seventy years\, he became the father of Mahalalel.  Kenan lived after the birth of Mahalalel eight hundred and forty years\, and had other sons and daughters.  Thus all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died.  \n\n When Mahalalel had lived sixty-five years\, he became the father of Jared.  Mahalalel lived after the birth of Jared eight hundred and thirty years\, and had other sons and daughters.  Thus all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred and ninety-five years; and he died.  \n\n When Jared had lived a hundred and sixty-two years he became the father of Enoch.  Jared lived after the birth of Enoch eight hundred years\, and had other sons and daughters.  Thus all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years; and he died.  When Enoch had lived sixty-five years\, he became the father of Methuselah.  Enoch walked with God after the birth of Methuselah three hundred years\, and had other sons and daughters.  Thus all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years.  Enoch walked with God; and he was not\, for God took him.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 6:3-20\nThen do this\, my son\, and save yourself\, for you have come into your neighbor's power: go\, hasten\, and importune your neighbor.  Give your eyes no sleep and your eyelids no slumber; save yourself like a gazelle from the hunter\, like a bird from the hand of the fowler.\n\n  Go to the ant\, O sluggard; consider her ways\, and be wise.  Without having any chief\, officer or ruler\, she prepares her food in summer\, and gathers her sustenance in harvest.  How long will you lie there\, O sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep?  A little sleep\, a little slumber\, a little folding of the hands to rest\, and poverty will come upon you like a vagabond\, and want like an armed man.  A worthless person\, a wicked man\, goes about with crooked speech\, winks with his eyes\, scrapes with his feet\, points with his finger\, with perverted heart devises evil\, continually sowing discord; therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in a moment he will be broken beyond healing.\n\n  There are six things which the LORD hates\, seven which are an abomination to him:  haughty eyes\, a lying tongue\, and hands that shed innocent blood\, a heart that devises wicked plans\, feet that make haste to run to evil\, a false witness who breathes out lies\, and a man who sows discord among brothers.  My son\, keep your father's commandment\, and forsake not your mother's teaching.\n\n

SUMMARY:Benedict the Righteous of Nursia
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/14/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Benedict the Righteous of Nursia; Euschemon the Confessor\, Bishop of Lampasakos\n\nStrict Fast\n\nOld Testament Reading: Isaiah 7:1-14\nIn the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham\, son of Uzziah\, king of Judah\, Rezin the king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah the king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to wage war against it\, but they could not conquer it.  When the house of David was told\, \"Syria is in league with Ephraim\,\" his heart and the heart of his people shook as the trees of the forest shake before the wind.\n\nAnd the LORD said to Isaiah\, \"Go forth to meet Ahaz\, you and Shearjashub your son\, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Fuller's Field\, and say to him\, 'Take heed\, be quiet\, do not fear\, and do not let your heart be faint because of these two smoldering stumps of firebrands\, at the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria and the son of Remaliah.  Because Syria\, with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah\, has devised evil against you\, saying\,  \"Let us go up against Judah and terrify it\, and let us conquer it for ourselves\, and set up the son of Tabeel as king in the midst of it\,\" thus says the Lord GOD: It shall not stand\, and it shall not come to pass.  For the head of Syria is Damascus\, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. (Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be broken to pieces so that it will no longer be a people.)  And the head of Ephraim is Samaria\, and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you will not believe\, surely you shall not be established.'\"\n\nAgain the LORD spoke to Ahaz\,  \"Ask a sign of the LORD your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven.\"  But Ahaz said\, \"I will not ask\, and I will not put the LORD to the test.\"  And he said\, \"Hear then\, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men\, that you weary my God also?  Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold\, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son\, and shall call his name Immanuel.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 5:32-6:8\n After Noah was five hundred years old\, Noah became the father of Shem\, Ham\, and Japheth.  When men began to multiply on the face of the ground\, and daughters were born to them\, the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were fair; and they took to wife such of them as they chose.  Then the LORD said\, \"My spirit shall not abide in man for ever\, for he is flesh\, but his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.\"  The Nephilim were on the earth in those days\, and also afterward\, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men\, and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men that were of old\, the men of renown.  \n\n The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth\, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.  And the LORD was sorry that he had made man on the earth\, and it grieved him to his heart.  So the LORD said\, \"I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the ground\, man and beast and creeping things and birds of the air\, for I am sorry that I have made them.\"  But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 6:20-7:1\nMy son\, keep your father's commandment\, and forsake not your mother's teaching.  Bind them upon your heart always; tie them about your neck.  When you walk\, they will lead you; when you lie down\, they will watch over you; and when you awake\, they will talk with you.  For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching a light\, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life\, to preserve you from the evil woman\, from the smooth tongue of the adventuress.  Do not desire her beauty in your heart\, and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes; for a harlot may be hired for a loaf of bread\, but an adulteress stalks a man's very life.  Can a man carry fire in his bosom and his clothes not be burned?  Or can one walk upon hot coals and his feet not be scorched?  So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife; none who touches her will go unpunished.  Do not men despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his appetite when he is hungry?  And if he is caught\, he will pay sevenfold; he will give all the goods of his house.  He who commits adultery has no sense; he who does it destroys himself.  Wounds and dishonor will he get\, and his disgrace will not be wiped away.  For jealousy makes a man furious\, and he will not spare when he takes revenge.  He will accept no compensation\, nor be appeased though you multiply gifts.  My son\, keep my words and treasure up my commandments with you.\n\n

But exhort one another every day\, as long as it is called \"today\,\" that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. For we share in Christ\, if only we hold our first confidence firm to the end\, while it is said\, \"Today\, when you hear his voice\, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.\" Who were they that heard and yet were rebellious? Was it not all those who left Egypt under the leadership of Moses? \n\nGospel Reading: Mark 1:35-44\nAt that time\, Jesus went out to a lonely place\, and there he prayed. And Simon and those who were with him pursued him\, and they found him and said to him\, \"Everyone is searching for you.\" And he said to them\, \"Let us go on to the next towns\, that I may preach there also; for that is why I came out.\" And he went throughout all Galilee\, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons. And a leper came to him beseeching him\, and kneeling said to him\, \"If you will\, you can make me clean.\" Moved with pity\, he stretched out his hand and touched him\, and said to him\, \"I will; be clean.\" And immediately the leprosy left him\, and he was made clean. And he sternly charged him\, and sent him away at once\, and said to him\, \"See that you say nothing to any one; but go\, show yourself to a priest\, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded\, for a proof to them.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Sunday of St. Gregory Palamas
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/16/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Sunday of St. Gregory Palamas; Sabine the Martyr of Egypt; Christodulus the Wonderworker of Patmos; Aristovoulos\, Apostle of the 70; Julian the Martyr; Romanos the Hieromartyr of Parium\n\nFast Day (Wine and Oil Allowed)\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Luke 24:12-35\nAt that time\, [Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in\, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home wondering at what had happened. That very day] two of them were going to a village named Emmaus\, about seven miles from Jerusalem\, and talking with each other about all these things that had happened. While they were talking and discussing together\, Jesus Himself drew near and went with them. But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him. And He said to them\, \"What is this conversation which you are holding with each other as you walk?\" and they stood still\, looking sad. Then one of them\, named Cleopas\, answered Him\, \"Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?\" And He said to them\, \"What things?\" And they said to him\, \"Concerning Jesus of Nazareth\, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people\, and how our chief priests and rulers delivered Him up to be condemned to death\, and crucified Him. But we had hoped that He was the one to redeem Israel. Yes\, and besides all this\, it is now the third day since this happened. Moreover\, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning and did not find His body; and they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels\, who said that He was alive. Some of those who were with us went to the tomb\, and found it just as the women had said; but Him they did not see.\" And He said to them\, \"O foolish men\, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Was not it necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into this glory?\" And beginning with Moses and all the prophets\, He interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning Himself. So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He appeared to be going further\, but they constrained Him\, saying\, \"Stay with us\, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.\" So He went in to stay with them. When He was at table with them\, He took the bread and blessed\, and broke it\, and gave it to them. And their eyes were opened and they recognized Him; and He vanished out of their sight. They said to each other\, \"Did not our hearts burn within us while He talked to us on the road\, while He opened to us the scriptures?\" And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven gathered together and those who were with them\, who said\, \"The Lord has risen indeed\, and has appeared to Simon!\" Then they told what had happened on the road and how He was known to them in the breaking of the bread.\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 1:10-14;2:1-3\nIN THE BEGINNING\, Thou\, Lord\, didst found the earth in the beginning\, and the heavens are the work of thy hands; they will perish\, but thou remainest; they will all grow old like a garment\, like a mantle thou wilt roll them up\, and they will be changed. But thou art the same\, and thy years will never end.\" But to what angel has he ever said\, \"Sit at my right hand\, till I make thy enemies a stool for thy feet?\" Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to serve\, for the sake of those who are to obtain salvation?\n\nTherefore we must pay closer attention to what we have heard\, lest we drift away from it. For if the message declared by angels was valid and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution\, how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord\, and it was attested to us by those who heard him.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 2:1-12\nAt that time\, Jesus entered Capernaum and it was reported that he was at home. And many were gathered together\, so that there was no longer room for them\, not even about the door; and he was preaching the word to them. And they came\, bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men. And when they could not get near him because of the crowd\, they removed the roof above him; and when they had made an opening\, they let down the pallet on which the paralytic lay. And when Jesus saw their faith\, he said to the paralytic\, \"My son\, your sins are forgiven.\" Now some of the scribes were sitting there\, questioning in their hearts\, \"Why does this man speak thus? It is a blasphemy! Who can forgive sins but God alone?\" And immediately Jesus\, perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves\, said to them\, \"Why do you question thus in your hearts? Which is easier\, to say to the paralytic\, 'Your sins are forgiven\,' or to say\, 'Rise\, take up your pallet and walk? But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins\"-he said to the paralytic-\"I say to you\, rise\, take up your pallet and go home.\" And he rose\, and immediately took up the pallet and went out before them all; so that they were all amazed and glorified God\, saying\, \"We never saw anything like this!\"\n\n

And he will become a sanctuary\, and a stone of offense\, and a rock of stumbling to both houses of Israel\, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.  And many shall stumble thereon; they shall fall and be broken; they shall be snared and taken.\"  \n\n Bind up the testimony\, seal the teaching among my disciples.  I will wait for the LORD\, who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob\, and I will hope in him.  Behold\, I and the children whom the LORD has given me are signs and portents in Israel from the LORD of hosts\, who dwells on Mount Zion.  And when they say to you\, \"Consult the mediums and the wizards who chirp and mutter\,\" should not a people consult their God? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living?  To the teaching and to the testimony! Surely for this word which they speak there is no dawn.  They will pass through the land\, greatly distressed and hungry; and when they are hungry\, they will be enraged and will curse their king and their God\, and turn their faces upward; and they will look to the earth\, but behold\, distress and darkness\, the gloom of anguish; and they will be thrust into thick darkness.  \n\n But there will be no gloom for her that was in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali\, but in the latter time he will make glorious the way of the sea\, the land beyond the Jordan\, Galilee of the nations.  The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness\, on them has light shined.  Thou hast multiplied the nation\, thou hast increased its joy; they rejoice before thee as with joy at the harvest\, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.  For the yoke of his burden\, and the staff for his shoulder\, the rod of his oppressor\, thou hast broken as on the day of Midian.  For every boot of the tramping warrior in battle tumult and every garment rolled in blood will be burned as fuel for the fire.  For to us a child is born\, to us a son is given; and the government will be upon his shoulder\, and his name will be called \"Wonderful Counselor\, Mighty God\, Everlasting Father\, Prince of Peace.\"  Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end\, upon the throne of David\, and over his kingdom\, to establish it\, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and for evermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 6:9-22\n These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man\, blameless in his generation; Noah walked with God.  And Noah had three sons\, Shem\, Ham\, and Japheth.  Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight\, and the earth was filled with violence.  And God saw the earth\, and behold\, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.  And God said to Noah\, \"I have determined to make an end of all flesh; for the earth is filled with violence through them; behold\, I will destroy them with the earth.  Make yourself an ark of gopher wood; make rooms in the ark\, and cover it inside and out with pitch.  This is how you are to make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits\, its breadth fifty cubits\, and its height thirty cubits.  Make a roof for the ark\, and finish it to a cubit above; and set the door of the ark in its side; make it with lower\, second\, and third decks.  For behold\, I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth\, to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life from under heaven; everything that is on the earth shall die.  But I will establish my covenant with you; and you shall come into the ark\, you\, your sons\, your wife\, and your sons' wives with you.  And of every living thing of all flesh\, you shall bring two of every sort into the ark\, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female.  Of the birds according to their kinds\, and of the animals according to their kinds\, of every creeping thing of the ground according to its kind\, two of every sort shall come in to you\, to keep them alive.  Also take with you every sort of food that is eaten\, and store it up; and it shall serve as food for you and for them.\"  Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 8:1-21\nDoes not wisdom call\, does not understanding raise her voice? On the heights beside the way\, in the paths she takes her stand; beside the gates in front of the town\, at the entrance of the portals she cries aloud:  \"To you\, O men\, I call\, and my cry is to the sons of men.O simple ones\, learn prudence; O foolish men\, pay attention.  Hear\, for I will speak noble things\, and from my lips will come what is right; for my mouth will utter truth; wickedness is an abomination to my lips.  All the words of my mouth are righteous; there is nothing twisted or crooked in them.  They are all straight to him who understands and right to those who find knowledge.  Take my instruction instead of silver\, and knowledge rather than choice gold; for wisdom is better than jewels\, and all that you may desire cannot compare with her.  I\, wisdom\, dwell in prudence\, and I find knowledge and discretion.  The fear of the LORD is hatred of evil. Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverted speech I hate.  I have counsel and sound wisdom\, I have insight\, I have strength.  By me kings reign\, and rulers decree what is just; by me princes rule\, and nobles govern the earth.  I love those who love me\, and those who seek me diligently find me.  Riches and honor are with me\, enduring wealth and prosperity.  My fruit is better than gold\, even fine gold\, and my yield than choice silver.  I walk in the way of righteousness\, in the paths of justice\, endowing with wealth those who love me\, and filling their treasuries.\n\n

SUMMARY:Cyril\, Patriarch of Jerusalem
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/18/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Cyril\, Patriarch of Jerusalem; Trophimos & Eukarpion\, Monk-martyrs of Nicomedea; Edward the Martyr\, King of England\n\nStrict Fast\n\nOld Testament Reading: Isaiah 9:9-10:4\nThus says the LORD: \"And all the people will know\, Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria\, who say in pride and in arrogance of heart:  'The bricks have fallen\, but we will build with dressed stones; the sycamores have been cut down\, but we will put cedars in their place.'\"  So the LORD raises adversaries against them\, and stirs up their enemies.  The Syrians on the east and the Philistines on the west devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away and his hand is stretched out still.  The people did not turn to him who smote them\, nor seek the LORD of hosts.  So the LORD cut off from Israel head and tail\, palm branch and reed in one day - the elder and honored man is the head\, and the prophet who teaches lies is the tail; for those who lead this people lead them astray\, and those who are led by them are swallowed up.  Therefore the Lord does not rejoice over their young men\, and has no compassion on their fatherless and widows; for every one is godless and an evildoer\, and every mouth speaks folly. For all this his anger is not turned away and his hand is stretched out still.  For wickedness burns like a fire\, it consumes briers and thorns; it kindles the thickets of the forest\, and they roll upward in a column of smoke.  Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts the land is burned\, and the people are like fuel for the fire; no man spares his brother.  They snatch on the right\, but are still hungry\, and they devour on the left\, but are not satisfied; each devours his neighbor's flesh\, Manasseh\, Ephraim\, and Ephraim\, Manasseh\, and together they are against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away and his hand is stretched out still.  \n\n Woe to those who decree iniquitous decrees\, and the writers who keep writing oppression\, to turn aside the needy from justice and to rob the poor of my people of their right\, that widows may be their spoil\, and that they may make the fatherless their prey!  What will you do on the day of punishment\, in the storm which will come from afar? To whom will you flee for help\, and where will you leave your wealth?  Nothing remains but to crouch among the prisoners or fall among the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away and his hand is stretched out still.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 7:1-5\n Then the LORD said to Noah\, \"Go into the ark\, you and all your household\, for I have seen that you are righteous before me in this generation.  Take with you seven pairs of all clean animals\, the male and his mate; and a pair of the animals that are not clean\, the male and his mate; and seven pairs of the birds of the air also\, male and female\, to keep their kind alive upon the face of all the earth.  For in seven days I will send rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made I will blot out from the face of the ground.\"  And Noah did all that the LORD had commanded him.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 8:32-9:11\nAnd now\, my sons\, listen to me: happy are those who keep my ways.  Hear instruction and be wise\, and do not neglect it.  Happy is the man who listens to me\, watching daily at my gates\, waiting beside my doors.  For he who finds me finds life and obtains favor from the LORD; but he who misses me injures himself; all who hate me love death.\"  Wisdom has built her house\, she has set up her seven pillars.  She has slaughtered her beasts\, she has mixed her wine\, she has also set her table.  She has sent out her maids to call from the highest places in the town\,  \"Whoever is simple\, let him turn in here!\" To him who is without sense she says\,  \"Come\, eat of my bread and drink of the wine I have mixed.  Leave simpleness\, and live\, and walk in the way of insight.\"  He who corrects a scoffer gets himself abuse\, and he who reproves a wicked man incurs injury.  Do not reprove a scoffer\, or he will hate you; reprove a wise man\, and he will love you.  Give instruction to a wise man\, and he will be still wiser; teach a righteous man and he will increase in learning.  The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom\, and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight.  For by me your days will be multiplied\, and years will be added to your life. \n\n

SUMMARY:The Holy Martyrs Chrysanthus and Daria
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/19/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: The Holy Martyrs Chrysanthus and Daria; Demetrios the New Martyr\n\nStrict Fast\n\nOld Testament Reading: Isaiah 10:12-20\n When the Lord has finished all his work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem he will punish the arrogant boasting of the king of Assyria and his haughty pride.  For he says: \"By the strength of my hand I have done it\, and by my wisdom\, for I have understanding; I have removed the boundaries of peoples\, and have plundered their treasures; like a bull I have brought down those who sat on thrones.  My hand has found like a nest the wealth of the peoples; and as men gather eggs that have been forsaken so I have gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved a wing\, or opened the mouth\, or chirped.\"  Shall the axe vaunt itself over him who hews with it\, or the saw magnify itself against him who wields it? As if a rod should wield him who lifts it\, or as if a staff should lift him who is not wood!  Therefore the Lord\, the LORD of hosts\, will send wasting sickness among his stout warriors\, and under his glory a burning will be kindled\, like the burning of fire.  The light of Israel will become a fire\, and his Holy One a flame; and it will burn and devour his thorns and briers in one day.  The glory of his forest and of his fruitful land the LORD will destroy\, both soul and body\, and it will be as when a sick man wastes away.  The remnant of the trees of his forest will be so few that a child can write them down.  In that day the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will no more lean upon him that smote them\, but will lean upon the LORD\, the Holy One of Israel\, in truth.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 7:6-9\n Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came upon the earth.  And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him went into the ark\, to escape the waters of the flood.  Of clean animals\, and of animals that are not clean\, and of birds\, and of everything that creeps on the ground\, two and two\, male and female\, went into the ark with Noah\, as God had commanded Noah.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 9:12-18\nIf you are wise\, you are wise for yourself; if you scoff\, you alone will bear it.  A foolish woman is noisy; she is wanton and knows no shame.  She sits at the door of her house\, she takes a seat on the high places of the town\, calling to those who pass by\, who are going straight on their way\,  \"Whoever is simple\, let him turn in here!\" And to him who is without sense she says\,  \"Stolen water is sweet\, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.\"  But he does not know that the dead are there\, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.\n\n

SUMMARY:Righteous Fathers slain at the Monastery of St. Savas
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/20/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Righteous Fathers slain at the Monastery of St. Savas; Myron the New Martyr of Crete; Cuthbert the Wonderworker\, Bishop of Lindisfarne; Photini the Samaritan Woman\n\nStrict Fast\n\nOld Testament Reading: Isaiah 11:10-12:2\n Thus says the LORD: In that day the root of Jesse shall stand as an ensign to the peoples; him shall the nations seek\, and his dwellings shall be glorious. \n\n In that day the Lord will extend his hand yet a second time to recover the remnant which is left of his people\, from Assyria\, from Egypt\, from Pathros\, from Ethiopia\, from Elam\, from Shinar\, from Hamath\, and from the coastlands of the sea.  He will raise an ensign for the nations\, and will assemble the outcasts of Israel\, and gather the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.  The jealousy of Ephraim shall depart\, and those who harass Judah shall be cut off; Ephraim shall not be jealous of Judah\, and Judah shall not harass Ephraim.  But they shall swoop down upon the shoulder of the Philistines in the west\, and together they shall plunder the people of the east. They shall put forth their hand against Edom and Moab\, and the Ammonites shall obey them.  And the LORD will utterly destroy the tongue of the sea of Egypt; and will wave his hand over the River with his scorching wind\, and smite it into seven channels that men may cross dryshod.  And there will be a highway from Assyria for the remnant which is left of his people\, as there was for Israel when they came up from the land of Egypt.  \n\n You will say in that day: \"I will give thanks to thee\, O LORD\, for though thou wast angry with me\, thy anger turned away\, and thou didst comfort me.  \"Behold\, God is my salvation; I will trust\, and will not be afraid; for the LORD GOD is my strength and my song\, and he has become my salvation.\"\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 7:11-8:3\n In the six hundredth year of Noah's life\, in the second month\, on the seventeenth day of the month\, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth\, and the windows of the heavens were opened.  And rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.  On the very same day Noah and his sons\, Shem and Ham and Japheth\, and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with them entered the ark\, they and every beast according to its kind\, and all the cattle according to their kinds\, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth according to its kind\, and every bird according to its kind\, every bird of every sort.  They went into the ark with Noah\, two and two of all flesh in which there was the breath of life.  And they that entered\, male and female of all flesh\, went in as God had commanded him; and the LORD shut him in.  \n\n The flood continued forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased\, and bore up the ark\, and it rose high above the earth.  The waters prevailed and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark floated on the face of the waters.  And the waters prevailed so mightily upon the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered; the waters prevailed above the mountains\, covering them fifteen cubits deep.  And all flesh died that moved upon the earth\, birds\, cattle\, beasts\, all swarming creatures that swarm upon the earth\, and every man; everything on the dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died.  He blotted out every living thing that was upon the face of the ground\, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the air; they were blotted out from the earth. Only Noah was left\, and those that were with him in the ark.  And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.  But God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the cattle that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind blow over the earth\, and the waters subsided; the fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed\, the rain from the heavens was restrained\, and the waters receded from the earth continually. At the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters had abated.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 10:1-22\nA wise son makes a glad father\, but a foolish son is a sorrow to his mother.  Treasures gained by wickedness do not profit\, but righteousness delivers from death.  The LORD does not let the righteous go hungry\, but he thwarts the craving of the wicked.  A slack hand causes poverty\, but the hand of the diligent makes rich.  A son who gathers in summer is prudent\, but a son who sleeps in harvest brings shame.  Blessings are on the head of the righteous\, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.  The memory of the righteous is a blessing\, but the name of the wicked will rot.  The wise of heart will heed commandments\, but a prating fool will come to ruin.  He who walks in integrity walks securely\, but he who perverts his ways will be found out.  He who winks the eye causes trouble\, but he who boldly reproves makes peace.  The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life\, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.  Hatred stirs up strife\, but love covers all offenses.  On the lips of him who has understanding wisdom is found\, but a rod is for the back of him who lacks sense.  Wise men lay up knowledge\, but the babbling of a fool brings ruin near.  A rich man's wealth is his strong city; the poverty of the poor is their ruin.  The wage of the righteous leads to life\, the gain of the wicked to sin.  He who heeds instruction is on the path to life\, but he who rejects reproof goes astray.  He who conceals hatred has lying lips\, and he who utters slander is a fool.  When words are many\, transgression is not lacking\, but he who restrains his lips is prudent.  The tongue of the righteous is choice silver; the mind of the wicked is of little worth.  The lips of the righteous feed many\, but fools die for lack of sense.  The blessing of the LORD makes rich\, and he adds no sorrow with it.\n\n

SUMMARY:James the Confessor
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/21/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: James the Confessor; Thomas I\, Patriarch of Constantinople; Philemon and Domninos\n\nStrict Fast\n\nOld Testament Reading: Isaiah 13:2-13\n On a bare hill raise a signal\, cry aloud to them; wave the hand for them to enter the gates of the nobles.  I myself have commanded my consecrated ones\, have summoned my mighty men to execute my anger\, my proudly exulting ones.  \n\n Hark\, a tumult on the mountains as of a great multitude! Hark\, an uproar of kingdoms\, of nations gathering together! The LORD of hosts is mustering a host for battle.  They come from a distant land\, from the end of the heavens\, the LORD and the weapons of his indignation\, to destroy the whole earth.  \n\n Wail\, for the day of the LORD is near; as destruction from the Almighty it will come!  Therefore all hands will be feeble\, and every man's heart will melt\, and they will be dismayed. Pangs and agony will seize them; they will be in anguish like a woman in travail. They will look aghast at one another; their faces will be aflame.  \n\n Behold\, the day of the LORD comes\, cruel\, with wrath and fierce anger\, to make the earth a desolation and to destroy its sinners from it.  For the stars of the heavens and their constellations will not give their light; the sun will be dark at its rising and the moon will not shed its light.  I will punish the world for its evil\, and the wicked for their iniquity; I will put an end to the pride of the arrogant\, and lay low the haughtiness of the ruthless.  I will make men more rare than fine gold\, and mankind than the gold of Ophir.  Therefore I will make the heavens tremble\, and the earth will be shaken out of its place\, at the wrath of the LORD of hosts in the day of his fierce anger.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 8:4-21\n And in the seventh month\, on the seventeenth day of the month\, the ark came to rest upon the mountains of Ararat.  And the waters continued to abate until the tenth month; in the tenth month\, on the first day of the month\, the tops of the mountains were seen.  \n\n At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made\, and sent forth a raven; and it went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth.  Then he sent forth a dove from him\, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground; but the dove found no place to set her foot\, and she returned to him to the ark\, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put forth his hand and took her and brought her into the ark with him.  He waited another seven days\, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; and the dove came back to him in the evening\, and lo\, in her mouth a freshly plucked olive leaf; so Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth.  Then he waited another seven days\, and sent forth the dove; and she did not return to him any more.  \n\n In the six hundred and first year\, in the first month\, the first day of the month\, the waters were dried from off the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark\, and looked\, and behold\, the face of the ground was dry.  In the second month\, on the twenty-seventh day of the month\, the earth was dry.  Then God said to Noah\,  \"Go forth from the ark\, you and your wife\, and your sons and your sons' wives with you.  Bring forth with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh - birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth - that they may breed abundantly on the earth\, and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth.\"  So Noah went forth\, and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him.  And every beast\, every creeping thing\, and every bird\, everything that moves upon the earth\, went forth by families out of the ark.  \n\n Then Noah built an altar to the LORD\, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird\, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.  And when the LORD smelled the pleasing odor\, the LORD said in his heart\, \"I will never again curse the ground because of man\, for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done.\"\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 10:31-11:12\nThe mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom\, but the perverse tongue will be cut off.  The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable\, but the mouth of the wicked\, what is perverse.  A false balance is an abomination to the LORD\, but a just weight is his delight.  When pride comes\, then comes disgrace; but with the humble is wisdom.  The integrity of the upright guides them\, but the crookedness of the treacherous destroys them.  Riches do not profit in the day of wrath\, but righteousness delivers from death.  The righteousness of the blameless keeps his way straight\, but the wicked falls by his own wickedness.  The righteousness of the upright delivers them\, but the treacherous are taken captive by their lust.  When the wicked dies\, his hope perishes\, and the expectation of the godless comes to nought.  The righteous is delivered from trouble\, and the wicked gets into it instead.  With his mouth the godless man would destroy his neighbor\, but by knowledge the righteous are delivered.  When it goes well with the righteous\, the city rejoices; and when the wicked perish there are shouts of gladness.  By the blessing of the upright a city is exalted\, but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.  He who belittles his neighbor lacks sense\, but a man of understanding remains silent.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/22/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Third Saturday of Lent; Basil the Holy Martyr of Ancyra; Kalliniki & Vassilisa the Martyrs; Euthemios the New Martyr\n\nFast Day (Wine and Oil Allowed)\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 10:32-38\nBrethren\, recall the former days when\, after you were enlightened\, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings\, sometimes being publicly exposed to abuse and affliction\, and sometimes being partners with those so treated.  For you had compassion on the prisoners\, and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property\, since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one.  Therefore do not throw away your confidence\, which has a great reward.  For you have need of endurance\, so that you may do the will of God and receive what is promised.  \"For yet a little while\, and the coming one shall come and shall not tarry; but my righteous one shall live by faith.\"\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 2:14-17\nAt that time\, as Jesus passed on\, he saw Levi the son of Alphaios sitting at the tax office\, and he said to him\, \"Follow me.\" And he rose and followed him. And as he sat at table in his house\, many tax collectors and sinners were sitting with Jesus and his disciples; for there were many who followed him. And the scribes of the Pharisees\, when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors\, said to his disciples\, \"Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?\" And when Jesus heard it\, he said to them\, \"Those who are well have no need of a physician\, but those who are sick; I came not to call the righteous\, but sinners.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Sunday of the Holy Cross
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/23/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Sunday of the Holy Cross; The Holy Righteous Martyr Nicon and His 199 Disciples; Anatolios & Protoleon the Martyrs converted by the martyrdom of St. George; Luke the New Martyr of Mytilene\n\nFast Day (Wine and Oil Allowed)\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Luke 24:36-53\nAt that time\, having risen from the dead\, Jesus went up and stood among His disciples and said to them\, \"Peace be with you.\" But they were startled and frightened\, and supposed that they saw a spirit. And He said to them\, \"Why are you troubled\, and why do questionings rise in your hearts? See My hands and My feet\, that it is I Myself; handle Me\, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that I have.\" And when He had said this\, He showed them His hands and His feet. And while they still disbelieved for joy\, and wondered\, He said to them\, \"Have you anything here to eat?\" They gave Him a piece of broiled fish [and some honeycomb]\, and He took it and ate before them. Then He said to them\, \"These are My words which I spoke to you\, while I was still with you\, that everything written about Me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled.\" Then He opened their minds to understand the scriptures\, and said to them\, \"Thus it is written\, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead\, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in His name in all nations\, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. And behold\, I send the promise of My Father upon you; but stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.\" Then He led them out as far as Bethany\, and lifting up His hands\, He blessed them. While He blessed them\, He parted from them\, and was carried up into heaven. And they worshiped Him\, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy\, and were continually in the Temple blessing God.\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 4:14-16;5:1-6\nBRETHREN\, since we have a high priest who has passed through the heavens\, Jesus\, the Son of God\, let us hold fast our confession. For we have not a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses\, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are\, yet without sin. Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace\, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. For every high priest chosen from among men is appointed to act on behalf of men in relation to God\, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. He can deal gently with the ignorant and wayward\, since he himself is beset with weakness. Because of this he is bound to offer sacrifice for his own sins as well as for those of the people. And one does not take the honor upon himself\, but he is called by God\, just as Aaron was. So also Christ did not exalt himself to be made a high priest\, but was appointed by him who said to him\, \"Thou art my Son\, today I have begotten thee\"; as he says also in another place\, \"Thou art a priest for ever\, after the order of Melchizedek.\" \n\nGospel Reading: Mark 8:34-38; 9:1\nThe Lord said: \"If anyone wishes to come after me\, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel's will save it. For what does it profit a man\, to gain the whole world and forfeit his life? For what can a man give in return for his life? For whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation\, of him will the Son of man also be ashamed\, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.\" And he said to them\, \"Truly\, I say to you\, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God come with power.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Forefeast of the Annunciation of the Theotokos
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/24/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Forefeast of the Annunciation of the Theotokos; Righteous Artemon\, Bishop of Seleucia; Our Holy Father Theonas\, Archbishop of Thessolonica; Zachariah the Recluse\n\nStrict Fast\n\nOld Testament Reading: Isaiah 14:24-32\n The LORD of hosts has sworn: \"As I have planned\, so shall it be\, and as I have purposed\, so shall it stand\, that I will break the Assyrian in my land\, and upon my mountains trample him under foot; and his yoke shall depart from them\, and his burden from their shoulder.\"  This is the purpose that is purposed concerning the whole earth; and this is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations.  For the LORD of hosts has purposed\, and who will annul it? His hand is stretched out\, and who will turn it back?  In the year that King Ahaz died came this oracle:  \"Rejoice not\, O Philistia\, all of you\, that the rod which smote you is broken\, for from the serpent's root will come forth an adder\, and its fruit will be a flying serpent.  And the first-born of the poor will feed\, and the needy lie down in safety; but I will kill your root with famine\, and your remnant I will slay.  Wail\, O gate; cry\, O city; melt in fear\, O Philistia\, all of you! For smoke comes out of the north\, and there is no straggler in his ranks.\"  What will one answer the messengers of the nation? \"The LORD has founded Zion\, and in her the afflicted of his people find refuge.\"\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 8:21-9:7\n And when the LORD smelled the pleasing odor\, the LORD said in his heart\, \"I will never again curse the ground because of man\, for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done.  While the earth remains\, seedtime and harvest\, cold and heat\, summer and winter\, day and night\, shall not cease.\"  \n\n And God blessed Noah and his sons\, and said to them\, \"Be fruitful and multiply\, and fill the earth.  The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth\, and upon every bird of the air\, upon everything that creeps on the ground and all the fish of the sea; into your hand they are delivered.  Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; and as I gave you the green plants\, I give you everything.  Only you shall not eat flesh with its life\, that is\, its blood.  For your lifeblood I will surely require a reckoning; of every beast I will require it and of man; of every man's brother I will require the life of man.  Whoever sheds the blood of man\, by man shall his blood be shed; for God made man in his own image.  And you\, be fruitful and multiply\, bring forth abundantly on the earth and multiply in it.\"\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 11:19-12:6\nHe who is steadfast in righteousness will live\, but he who pursues evil will die.  Men of perverse mind are an abomination to the LORD\, but those of blameless ways are his delight.  Be assured\, an evil man will not go unpunished\, but those who are righteous will be delivered.  Like a gold ring in a swine's snout is a beautiful woman without discretion.  The desire of the righteous ends only in good; the expectation of the wicked in wrath.  One man gives freely\, yet grows all the richer; another withholds what he should give\, and only suffers want.  A liberal man will be enriched\, and one who waters will himself be watered.  The people curse him who holds back grain\, but a blessing is on the head of him who sells it.  He who diligently seeks good seeks favor\, but evil comes to him who searches for it.  He who trusts in his riches will wither\, but the righteous will flourish like a green leaf.  He who troubles his household will inherit wind\, and the fool will be servant to the wise.  The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life\, but lawlessness takes away lives.  If the righteous is requited on earth\, how much more the wicked and the sinner!  Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge\, but he who hates reproof is stupid.  A good man obtains favor from the LORD\, but a man of evil devices he condemns.  A man is not established by wickedness\, but the root of the righteous will never be moved.  A good wife is the crown of her husband\, but she who brings shame is like rottenness in his bones.  The thoughts of the righteous are just; the counsels of the wicked are treacherous.  The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood\, but the mouth of the upright delivers men.\n\n

SUMMARY:Annunciation of the Theotokos
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/25/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Annunciation of the Theotokos\n\nFast Day (Fish Allowed)\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Luke 1:39-49\, 56\nIn those days\, Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country\, to a city of Judah\, and she entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth. And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary\, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and she exclaimed with a loud cry\, \"Blessed are you among women\, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why is this granted me\, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold\, when the voice of your greeting came to my ears\, the babe in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.\"\n\n  And Mary said\, \"My soul magnifies the Lord\, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior\, for he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden. For behold\, henceforth all generations will call me blessed; for he who is mighty has done great things for me\, and holy is his name.\" And Mary remained with her about three months\, and returned to her home.\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 2:11-18\nBRETHREN\, he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified have all one origin. That is why he is not ashamed to call them brethren\, saying\, \"I will proclaim thy name to my brethren\, in the midst of the congregation I will praise thee.\" And again\, \"I will put my trust in him.\" And again\, \"Here am I\, and the children God has given me. Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood\, he himself likewise partook of the same nature\, that through death he might destroy him who has the power of death\, that is\, the devil\, and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong bondage. For surely it is not with angels that he is concerned but with the descendants of Abraham. Therefore he had to be made like his brethren in every respect\, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God\, to make expiation for the sins of the people. For because he himself has suffered and been tempted\, he is able to help those who are tempted. \n\nGospel Reading: Luke 1:24-38\nIn those days\, Elizabeth the wife of Zacharias conceived and for five months she hid herself\, saying\, \"Thus the Lord had done to me in the days when he looked on me\, to take away my reproach among men.\" In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth\, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph\, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. And he came to her and said\, \"Hail\, O favored one\, the Lord is with you! Blessed are you among women!\" But she was greatly troubled at the saying\, and considered in her mind what sort of greeting this might be. And the angel said to her\, \"Do not be afraid\, Mary\, for you have found favor with God. And behold\, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son\, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great\, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David\, and he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there will be no end.\" And Mary said to the angel\, \"How shall this be\, since I have no husband?\" And the angel said to her\, \"The Holy Spirit will come upon you\, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy\, the Son of God.\n\nAnd behold\, your kinswoman Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. For with God nothing will be impossible.\" And Mary said\, \"Behold\, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.\" And the angel departed from her.\n\n

SUMMARY:Synaxis in honor of the Archangel Gabriel
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/26/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Synaxis in honor of the Archangel Gabriel; 26 Martyrs in Crimea; Irenaeus the Hieromartyr of Hungary\n\nFast Day (Wine and Oil Allowed)\n\nOld Testament Reading: Isaiah 26:21-27:9\n For behold\, the LORD is coming forth out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity\, and the earth will disclose the blood shed upon her\, and will no more cover her slain.  In that day the LORD with his hard and great and strong sword will punish Leviathan the fleeing serpent\, Leviathan the twisting serpent\, and he will slay the dragon that is in the sea.  \n\n In that day: \"A pleasant vineyard\, sing of it!  I\, the LORD\, am its keeper; every moment I water it. Lest any one harm it\, I guard it night and day;  I have no wrath. Would that I had thorns and briers to battle! I would set out against them\, I would burn them up together.  Or let them lay hold of my protection\, let them make peace with me\, let them make peace with me.\"  \n\n In days to come Jacob shall take root\, Israel shall blossom and put forth shoots\, and fill the whole world with fruit.  \n\n Has he smitten them as he smote those who smote them? Or have they been slain as their slayers were slain?  Measure by measure\, by exile thou didst contend with them; he removed them with his fierce blast in the day of the east wind.  Therefore by this the guilt of Jacob will be expiated\, and this will be the full fruit of the removal of his sin: when he makes all the stones of the altars like chalkstones crushed to pieces\, no Asherim or incense altars will remain standing.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 9:18-10:1\nThe sons of Noah who went forth from the ark were Shem\, Ham\, and Japheth. Ham was the father of Canaan.  These three were the sons of Noah; and from these the whole earth was peopled.\n\nNoah was the first tiller of the soil. He planted a vineyard; and he drank of the wine\, and became drunk\, and lay uncovered in his tent.  And Ham\, the father of Canaan\, saw the nakedness of his father\, and told his two brothers outside.  Then Shem and Japheth took a garment\, laid it upon both their shoulders\, and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father; their faces were turned away\, and they did not see their father's nakedness.  When Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his youngest son had done to him\, he said\, \"Cursed be Canaan; a slave of slaves shall he be to his brothers.\"  He also said\, \"Blessed by the LORD my God be Shem; and let Canaan be his slave.  God enlarge Japheth\, and let him dwell in the tents of Shem; and let Canaan be his slave.\"  After the flood Noah lived three hundred and fifty years.  All the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years; and he died.  These are the generations of the sons of Noah\, Shem\, Ham\, and Japheth; sons were born to them after the flood.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 12:23-13:9\nA prudent man conceals his knowledge\, but fools proclaim their folly.  The hand of the diligent will rule\, while the slothful will be put to forced labor.  Anxiety in a man's heart weighs him down\, but a good word makes him glad.  A righteous man turns away from evil\, but the way of the wicked leads them astray.  A slothful man will not catch his prey\, but the diligent man will get precious wealth.  In the path of righteousness is life\, but the way of error leads to death.  A wise son hears his father's instruction\, but a scoffer does not listen to rebuke.  From the fruit of his mouth a good man eats good\, but the desire of the treacherous is for violence.  He who guards his mouth preserves his life; he who opens wide his lips comes to ruin.  The soul of the sluggard craves\, and gets nothing\, while the soul of the diligent is richly supplied.  A righteous man hates falsehood\, but a wicked man acts shamefully and disgracefully.  Righteousness guards him whose way is upright\, but sin overthrows the wicked.  One man pretends to be rich\, yet has nothing; another pretends to be poor\, yet has great wealth.  The ransom of a man's life is his wealth\, but a poor man has no means of redemption.  The light of the righteous rejoices\, but the lamp of the wicked will be put out.\n\n

SUMMARY:Martyr Matrona of Thessalonica
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/27/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Martyr Matrona of Thessalonica; Paul\, Bishop of Corinth\n\nStrict Fast\n\nOld Testament Reading: Isaiah 28:14-22\n Thus says the LORD\, you scoffers\, who rule this people in Jerusalem!  Because you have said\, \"We have made a covenant with death\, and with Sheol we have an agreement; when the overwhelming scourge passes through it will not come to us; for we have made lies our refuge\, and in falsehood we have taken shelter\"; therefore thus says the Lord GOD\, \"Behold\, I am laying in Zion for a foundation a stone\, a tested stone\, a precious cornerstone\, of a sure foundation: 'He who believes will not be in haste.'  And I will make justice the line\, and righteousness the plummet; and hail will sweep away the refuge of lies\, and waters will overwhelm the shelter.\"  Then your covenant with death will be annulled\, and your agreement with Sheol will not stand; when the overwhelming scourge passes through you will be beaten down by it.  As often as it passes through it will take you; for morning by morning it will pass through\, by day and by night; and it will be sheer terror to understand the message.  For the bed is too short to stretch oneself on it\, and the covering too narrow to wrap oneself in it.  For the LORD will rise up as on Mount Perazim\, he will be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon; to do his deed - strange is his deed! and to work his work - alien is his work!  Now therefore do not scoff\, lest your bonds be made strong; for I have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord GOD of hosts upon the whole land.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 10:32-11:9\n These are the families of the sons of Noah\, according to their genealogies\, in their nations; and from these the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood.  Now the whole earth had one language and few words.  And as men migrated from the east\, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there.  And they said to one another\, \"Come\, let us make bricks\, and burn them thoroughly.\" And they had brick for stone\, and bitumen for mortar.  Then they said\, \"Come\, let us build ourselves a city\, and a tower with its top in the heavens\, and let us make a name for ourselves\, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.\"  And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower\, which the sons of men had built.  And the LORD said\, \"Behold\, they are one people\, and they have all one language; and this is only the beginning of what they will do; and nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them.  Come\, let us go down\, and there confuse their language\, that they may not understand one another's speech.\"  So the LORD scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth\, and they left off building the city.  Therefore its name was called Babel\, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth; and from there the LORD scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 13:19-14:6\nA desire fulfilled is sweet to the soul; but to turn away from evil is an abomination to fools.  He who walks with wise men becomes wise\, but the companion of fools will suffer harm.  Misfortune pursues sinners\, but prosperity rewards the righteous.  A good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children\, but the sinner's wealth is laid up for the righteous.  The fallow ground of the poor yields much food\, but it is swept away through injustice.  He who spares the rod hates his son\, but he who loves him is diligent to discipline him.  The righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite\, but the belly of the wicked suffers want.  Wisdom builds her house\, but folly with her own hands tears it down.  He who walks in uprightness fears the LORD\, but he who is devious in his ways despises him.  The talk of a fool is a rod for his back\, but the lips of the wise will preserve them.  Where there are no oxen\, there is no grain; but abundant crops come by the strength of the ox.  A faithful witness does not lie\, but a false witness breathes out lies.  A scoffer seeks wisdom in vain\, but knowledge is easy for a man of understanding.\n\n

SUMMARY:Hilarion the New
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/28/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Hilarion the New; Herodion the Apostle of the 70; Stephen the Wonderworker\n\nStrict Fast\n\nOld Testament Reading: Isaiah 29:13-23\n And the Lord said: \"Because this people draw near with their mouth and honor me with their lips\, while their hearts are far from me\, and their fear of me is a commandment of men learned by rote; therefore\, behold\, I will again do marvelous things with this people\, wonderful and marvelous; and the wisdom of their wise men shall perish\, and the discernment of their discerning men shall be hid.\"  Woe to those who hide deep from the LORD their counsel\, whose deeds are in the dark\, and who say\, \"Who sees us? Who knows us?\"  You turn things upside down! Shall the potter be regarded as the clay; that the thing made should say of its maker\, \"He did not make me\"; or the thing formed say of him who formed it\, \"He has no understanding\"?  \n\n Is it not yet a very little while until Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field\, and the fruitful field shall be regarded as a forest?  In that day the deaf shall hear the words of a book\, and out of their gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind shall see.  The meek shall obtain fresh joy in the LORD\, and the poor among men shall exult in the Holy One of Israel.  For the ruthless shall come to nought and the scoffer cease\, and all who watch to do evil shall be cut off\, who by a word make a man out to be an offender\, and lay a snare for him who reproves in the gate\, and with an empty plea turn aside him who is in the right.  \n\n Therefore thus says the LORD\, who redeemed Abraham\, concerning the house of Jacob: \"Jacob shall no more be ashamed\, no more shall his face grow pale.  For when he sees his children\, the work of my hands\, in his midst\, they will sanctify my name; they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob\, and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 12:1-7\n Now the LORD said to Abram\, \"Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you.  And I will make of you a great nation\, and I will bless you\, and make your name great\, so that you will be a blessing.  I will bless those who bless you\, and him who curses you I will curse; and by you all the families of the earth shall bless themselves.\"  \n\n So Abram went\, as the LORD had told him; and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.  And Abram took Sarai his wife\, and Lot his brother's son\, and all their possessions which they had gathered\, and the persons that they had gotten in Haran; and they set forth to go to the land of Canaan. When they had come to the land of Canaan\, Abram passed through the land to the place at Shechem\, to the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.  Then the LORD appeared to Abram\, and said\, \"To your descendants I will give this land.\" So he built there an altar to the LORD\, who had appeared to him.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 14:15-26\nThe simple believes everything\, but the prudent looks where he is going.  A wise man is cautious and turns away from evil\, but a fool throws off restraint and is careless.  A man of quick temper acts foolishly\, but a man of discretion is patient.  The simple acquire folly\, but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.  The evil bow down before the good\, the wicked at the gates of the righteous.  The poor is disliked even by his neighbor\, but the rich has many friends.  He who despises his neighbor is a sinner\, but happy is he who is kind to the poor.  Do they not err that devise evil? Those who devise good meet loyalty and faithfulness.  In all toil there is profit\, but mere talk tends only to want.  The crown of the wise is their wisdom\, but folly is the garland of fools.  A truthful witness saves lives\, but one who utters lies is a betrayer.  In the fear of the LORD one has strong confidence\, and his children will have a refuge.\n\n

SUMMARY:Fourth Saturday of Lent
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/29/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Fourth Saturday of Lent; Mark\, Bishop of Arethusa; Martyr Cyril the Deacon and Those with him; The Holy Martyrs Jonas and Barachesius; Eustathios the Confessor\, Bishop of Bithynia\n\nFast Day (Wine and Oil Allowed)\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 6:9-12\nBRETHREN\, we feel sure of better things that belong to salvation. For God is not so unjust as to overlook your work and the love which you showed for his sake in serving the saints\, as you still do. And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness in realizing the full assurance of hope until the end\, so that you may not be sluggish\, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 7:31-37\nAt that time\, Jesus returned from the region of Tyre\, and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee\, through the region of Dekapolis. And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech; and they besought him to lay his hand upon him. And taking him aside from the multitude privately\, he put his fingers into his ears\, and he spat and touched his tongue; and looking up to heaven\, he sighed\, and said to him\, \"Ephphatha\,\" that is\, \"Be opened.\" And his ears were opened\, his tongue was released\, and he spoke plainly. And he charged them to tell no one; but the more he charged them\, the more zealously they proclaimed it. And they were astonished beyond measure\, saying\, \"He has done all things well: he even makes the deaf hear and the dumb speak.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Sunday of St. John Climacus
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/30/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Sunday of St. John Climacus; John Climacus the Righteous\, author of The Divine Ladder of Ascent; Sosthenes\, Apollos\, Cephas\, Caesar\, & Epaphroditos\, the Apostles of the 70; Zacharias the New Martyr\n\nFast Day (Wine and Oil Allowed)\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: John 20:1-10\nOn the first day of the week\, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early\, while it was still dark\, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb. So she ran\, and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple\, the one whom Jesus loved\, and said to them\, \"They have taken the Lord out of the tomb\, and we do not know where they have laid Him.\" Peter then came out with the other disciple\, and they went toward the tomb. They both ran\, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first; and stooping to look in\, he saw the linen cloths lying there\, but he did not go in. Then Simon Peter came\, following him\, and went into the tomb; he saw the linen cloths lying and the napkin\, which had been on His head\, not lying with the linen cloths\, but rolled up in a place by itself. Then the other disciple\, who reached the tomb first\, also went in\, and he saw and believed; for as yet they did not know the scripture\, that He must rise from the dead. Then the disciples went back to their homes.\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 6:13-20\nBRETHREN\, when God made a promise to Abraham\, since he had no one greater by whom to swear\, he swore to himself\, saying\, \"Surely I will bless you and multiply you.\" And thus Abraham\, having patiently endured\, obtained the promise. Men indeed swear by a greater than themselves\, and in all their disputes an oath is final for confirmation. So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose\, he interposed with an oath\, so that through two unchangeable things\, in which it is impossible that God should prove false\, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to seize the hope set before us. We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul\, a hope that enters into the inner shrine behind the curtain\, where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf\, having become a high priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. \n\nGospel Reading: Mark 9:17-31\nAt that time\, a man came to Jesus kneeling and saying: \"Teacher\, I brought my son to you\, for he has a dumb spirit; and wherever it seizes him it dashes him down; and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid; and I asked your disciples to cast it out\, and they were not able.\" And he answered them\, \"O faithless generation\, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to me.\" And they brought the boy to him; and when the spirit saw him\, immediately it convulsed the boy\, and he fell on the ground and rolled about\, foaming at the mouth. And Jesus asked his father\, \"How long has he had this?\" And he said\, \"From childhood. And it has often cast him into the fire and into the water\, to destroy him; but if you can do anything\, have pity on us and help us.\" And Jesus said to him\, \"If you can! All things are possible to him who believes.\" Immediately the father of the child cried out and said\, \"I believe; help my unbelief!\" And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together\, he rebuked the unclean spirit\, saying to it\, \"You dumb and deaf spirit\, I command you\, come out of him\, and never enter him again.\" And after crying out and convulsing him terribly\, it came out\, and the boy was like a corpse; so that most of them said\, \"He is dead.\" But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up\, and he arose. And when he had entered the house\, his disciples asked him privately\, \"Why could we not cast it out?\" And he said to them\, \"This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer and fasting.\" They went on from there and passed through Galilee. And he would not have any one know it; for he was teaching his disciples\, saying to them\, \"The Son of man will be delivered into the hands of men\, and they will kill him; and when he is killed\, after three days he will rise.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:The Holy Hieromartyr Hypatius\, Bishop of Gangra
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 03/31/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: The Holy Hieromartyr Hypatius\, Bishop of Gangra; Theophilos the Martyr and those with him; Innocent\, Enlightener of Siberia & Alaska; Akakios the Confessor\n\nStrict Fast\n\nOld Testament Reading: Isaiah 37:33-38:6\n\"Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come into this city\, or shoot an arrow there\, or come before it with a shield\, or cast up a siege mound against it.  By the way that he came\, by the same he shall return\, and he shall not come into this city\, says the LORD.  For I will defend this city to save it\, for my own sake and for the sake of my servant David.\"  And the angel of the LORD went forth\, and slew a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians; and when men arose early in the morning\, behold\, these were all dead bodies.  Then Sennacherib king of Assyria departed\, and went home and dwelt at Nineveh.  And as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god\, Adrammelech and Sharezer\, his sons\, slew him with the sword\, and escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead. \n\n  In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him\, and said to him\, \"Thus says the LORD: Set your house in order; for you shall die\, you shall not recover.\"  Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall\, and prayed to the LORD\, and said\, \"Remember now\, O LORD\, I beseech thee\, how I have walked before thee in faithfulness and with a whole heart\, and have done what is good in thy sight.\" And Hezekiah wept bitterly.  Then the word of the LORD came to Isaiah:  \"Go and say to Hezekiah\, Thus says the LORD\, the God of David your father: I have heard your prayer\, I have seen your tears; behold\, I will add fifteen years to your life.  I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria\, and defend this city.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 13:12-18\n Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan\, while Lot dwelt among the cities of the valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom.  Now the men of Sodom were wicked\, great sinners against the LORD.  \n\n The LORD said to Abram\, after Lot had separated from him\, \"Lift up your eyes\, and look from the place where you are\, northward and southward and eastward and westward; for all the land which you see I will give to you and to your descendants for ever.  I will make your descendants as the dust of the earth; so that if one can count the dust of the earth\, your descendants also can be counted.  Arise\, walk through the length and the breadth of the land\, for I will give it to you.\"  So Abram moved his tent\, and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre\, which are at Hebron; and there he built an altar to the LORD.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 14:27-15:4\nThe fear of the LORD is a fountain of life\, that one may avoid the snares of death.  In a multitude of people is the glory of a king\, but without people a prince is ruined.  He who is slow to anger has great understanding\, but he who has a hasty temper exalts folly.  A tranquil mind gives life to the flesh\, but passion makes the bones rot.  He who oppresses a poor man insults his Maker\, but he who is kind to the needy honors him.  The wicked is overthrown through his evil-doing\, but the righteous finds refuge through his integrity.  Wisdom abides in the mind of a man of understanding\, but it is not known in the heart of fools.  Righteousness exalts a nation\, but sin is a reproach to any people.  A servant who deals wisely has the king's favor\, but his wrath falls on one who acts shamefully.  A soft answer turns away wrath\, but a harsh word stirs up anger.  The tongue of the wise dispenses knowledge\, but the mouths of fools pour out folly.  The eyes of the LORD are in every place\, keeping watch on the evil and the good.  A gentle tongue is a tree of life\, but perverseness in it breaks the spirit.\n\n

SUMMARY:Mary of Egypt
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 04/01/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Mary of Egypt; Euthemios of Suzdal; Gerontios & Vasilides the Martyrs\n\nStrict Fast\n\nOld Testament Reading: Isaiah 40:18-31\nThus says the LORD: To whom then will you liken God\, or what likeness compare with him?  The idol! a workman casts it\, and a goldsmith overlays it with gold\, and casts for it silver chains.  He who is impoverished chooses for an offering wood that will not rot; he seeks out a skilful craftsman to set up an image that will not move.  \n\n Have you not known? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?  It is he who sits above the circle of the earth\, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers; who stretches out the heavens like a curtain\, and spreads them like a tent to dwell in; who brings princes to nought\, and makes the rulers of the earth as nothing.  \n\n Scarcely are they planted\, scarcely sown\, scarcely has their stem taken root in the earth\, when he blows upon them\, and they wither\, and the tempest carries them off like stubble.  \n\n To whom then will you compare me\, that I should be like him? Says the Holy One.  Lift up your eyes on high and see: who created these? He who brings out their host by number\, calling them all by name; by the greatness of his might\, and because he is strong in power not one is missing.  \n\n Why do you say\, O Jacob\, and speak\, O Israel\, \"My way is hid from the LORD\, and my right is disregarded by my God\"?  Have you not known? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God\, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary\, his understanding is unsearchable.  He gives power to the faint\, and to him who has no might he increases strength.  Even youths shall faint and be weary\, and young men shall fall exhausted; but they who wait for the LORD shall renew their strength\, they shall mount up with wings like eagles\, they shall run and not be weary\, they shall walk and not faint.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 15:1-15\n After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision\, \"Fear not\, Abram\, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.\"  But Abram said\, \"O Lord GOD\, what wilt thou give me\, for I continue childless\, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?\"  And Abram said\, \"Behold\, thou hast given me no offspring; and a slave born in my house will be my heir.\"  And behold\, the word of the LORD came to him\, \"This man shall not be your heir; your own son shall be your heir.\"  And he brought him outside and said\, \"Look toward heaven\, and number the stars\, if you are able to number them.\" Then he said to him\, \"So shall your descendants be.\"  And he believed the LORD; and he reckoned it to him as righteousness.  \n\n And he said to him\, \"I am the LORD who brought you from Ur of the Chaldeans\, to give you this land to possess.\"  But he said\, \"O Lord GOD\, how am I to know that I shall possess it?\"  He said to him\, \"Bring me a heifer three years old\, a she-goat three years old\, a ram three years old\, a turtledove\, and a young pigeon.\"  And he brought him all these\, cut them in two\, and laid each half over against the other; but he did not cut the birds in two.  And when birds of prey came down upon the carcasses\, Abram drove them away.  \n\n As the sun was going down\, a deep sleep fell on Abram; and lo\, a dread and great darkness fell upon him.  Then the LORD said to Abram\, \"Know of a surety that your descendants will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs\, and will be slaves there\, and they will be oppressed for four hundred years; but I will bring judgment on the nation which they serve\, and afterward they shall come out with great possessions.  As for yourself\, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 15:7-19\nThe lips of the wise spread knowledge; not so the minds of fools.  The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD\, but the prayer of the upright is his delight.  The way of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD\, but he loves him who pursues righteousness.  There is severe discipline for him who forsakes the way; he who hates reproof will die.  Sheol and Abaddon lie open before the LORD\, how much more the hearts of men!  A scoffer does not like to be reproved; he will not go to the wise.  A glad heart makes a cheerful countenance\, but by sorrow of heart the spirit is broken.  The mind of him who has understanding seeks knowledge\, but the mouths of fools feed on folly.  All the days of the afflicted are evil\, but a cheerful heart has a continual feast.  Better is a little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble with it.  Better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a fatted ox and hatred with it.  A hot-tempered man stirs up strife\, but he who is slow to anger quiets contention.  The way of a sluggard is overgrown with thorns\, but the path of the upright is a level highway.\n\n

SUMMARY:Titus the Wonderworker
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 04/02/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Titus the Wonderworker; Theodora the Virgin-martyr of Palestine; Amphianos & Aedesios the Martyrs of Lycia\n\nStrict Fast\n\nOld Testament Reading: Isaiah 41:4-14\nWho has performed and done this\, calling the generations from the beginning? I\, the LORD\, the first\, and with the last; I am He.  The coastlands have seen and are afraid\, the ends of the earth tremble; they have drawn near and come.  Every one helps his neighbor\, and says to his brother\, \"Take courage!\"  The craftsman encourages the goldsmith\, and he who smoothes with the hammer him who strikes the anvil\, saying of the soldering\, \"It is good\"; and they fasten it with nails so that it cannot be moved.  \n\n But you\, Israel\, my servant\, Jacob\, whom I have chosen\, the offspring of Abraham\, my friend; you whom I took from the ends of the earth\, and called from its farthest corners\, saying to you\, \"You are my servant\, I have chosen you and not cast you off\"; fear not\, for I am with you\, be not dismayed\, for I am your God; I will strengthen you\, I will help you\, I will uphold you with my victorious right hand. \n\n  Behold\, all who are incensed against you shall be put to shame and confounded; those who strive against you shall be as nothing and shall perish.  You shall seek those who contend with you\, but you shall not find them; those who war against you shall be as nothing at all.  For I\, the LORD your God\, hold your right hand; it is I who say to you\, \"Fear not\, I will help you.\"  Fear not\, you worm Jacob\, you men of Israel! I will help you\, says the LORD; your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 17:1-9\n When Abram was ninety-nine years old the LORD appeared to Abram\, and said to him\, \"I am God Almighty; walk before me\, and be blameless.  And I will make my covenant between me and you\, and will multiply you exceedingly.\"  Then Abram fell on his face; and God said to him\,  \"Behold\, my covenant is with you\, and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations.  No longer shall your name be Abram\, but your name shall be Abraham; for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.  I will make you exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations of you\, and kings shall come forth from you.  And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant\, to be God to you and to your descendants after you.  And I will give to you\, and to your descendants after you\, the land of your sojournings\, all the land of Canaan\, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.\"\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 15:20-16:9\nA wise son makes a glad father\, but a foolish man despises his mother.  Folly is a joy to him who has no sense\, but a man of understanding walks aright.  Without counsel plans go wrong\, but with many advisers they succeed.  To make an apt answer is a joy to a man\, and a word in season\, how good it is!  The wise man's path leads upward to life\, that he may avoid Sheol beneath.  The LORD tears down the house of the proud\, but maintains the widow's boundaries.  The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD\, the words of the pure are pleasing to him.  He who is greedy for unjust gain makes trouble for his household\, but he who hates bribes will live.  The mind of the righteous ponders how to answer\, but the mouth of the wicked pours out evil things.  The LORD is far from the wicked\, but he hears the prayer of the righteous.  The light of the eyes rejoices the heart\, and good news refreshes the bones.  He whose ear heeds wholesome admonition will abide among the wise.  He who ignores instruction despises himself\, but he who heeds admonition gains understanding.  The fear of the LORD is instruction in wisdom\, and humility goes before honor.  The plans of the mind belong to man\, but the answer of the tongue is from the LORD.  All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes\, but the LORD weighs the spirit.  Commit your work to the LORD\, and your plans will be established.  The LORD has made everything for its purpose\, even the wicked for the day of trouble.  Every one who is arrogant is an abomination to the LORD; be assured\, he will not go unpunished.  By loyalty and faithfulness iniquity is atoned for\, and by the fear of the LORD a man avoids evil.  When a man's ways please the LORD\, he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.  Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues with injustice.  A man's mind plans his way\, but the LORD directs his steps.\n\n

SUMMARY:5th Thursday of Lent: The Great Canon of Saint Andrew of Crete
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 04/03/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: 5th Thursday of Lent: The Great Canon of Saint Andrew of Crete; Nicetas\, Abbot of the Monastery of Medicium; Joseph the Hymnographer; Theodosia and Irene the Martyrs\n\nFast Day (Wine and Oil Allowed)\n\nOld Testament Reading: Isaiah 42:5-16\nThus says God\, the LORD\, who created the heavens and stretched them out\, who spread forth the earth and what comes from it\, who gives breath to the people upon it and spirit to those who walk in it:  \"I am the LORD\, I have called you in righteousness\, I have taken you by the hand and kept you; I have given you as a covenant to the people\, a light to the nations\, to open the eyes that are blind\, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon\, from the prison those who sit in darkness.  I am the LORD\, that is my name; my glory I give to no other\, nor my praise to graven images.  Behold\, the former things have come to pass\, and new things I now declare; before they spring forth I tell you of them.\" \n\n  Sing to the LORD a new song\, his praise from the end of the earth! Let the sea roar and all that fills it\, the coastlands and their inhabitants.  Let the desert and its cities lift up their voice\, the villages that Kedar inhabits; let the inhabitants of Sela sing for joy\, let them shout from the top of the mountains.  Let them give glory to the LORD\, and declare his praise in the coastlands.  The LORD goes forth like a mighty man\, like a man of war he stirs up his fury; he cries out\, he shouts aloud\, he shows himself mighty against his foes. \n\n  For a long time I have held my peace\, I have kept still and restrained myself; now I will cry out like a woman in travail\, I will gasp and pant.  I will lay waste mountains and hills\, and dry up all their herbage; I will turn the rivers into islands\, and dry up the pools.  And I will lead the blind in a way that they know not\, in paths that they have not known I will guide them. I will turn the darkness before them into light\, the rough places into level ground. These are the things I will do\, and I will not forsake them.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 18:20-33\n Then the LORD said\, \"Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great and their sin is very grave\, I will go down to see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry which has come to me; and if not\, I will know.\"  So the men turned from there\, and went toward Sodom; but Abraham still stood before the LORD.  Then Abraham drew near\, and said\, \"Wilt thou indeed destroy the righteous with the wicked?  Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city; wilt thou then destroy the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous who are in it?  Far be it from thee to do such a thing\, to slay the righteous with the wicked\, so that the righteous fare as the wicked! Far be that from thee! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\"  And the LORD said\, \"If I find at Sodom fifty righteous in the city\, I will spare the whole place for their sake.\"  Abraham answered\, \"Behold\, I have taken upon myself to speak to the Lord\, I who am but dust and ashes.  Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking? Wilt thou destroy the whole city for lack of five?\" And he said\, \"I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.\"  Again he spoke to him\, and said\, \"Suppose forty are found there.\" He answered\, \"For the sake of forty I will not do it.\"  Then he said\, \"Oh let not the Lord be angry\, and I will speak. Suppose thirty are found there.\" He answered\, \"I will not do it\, if I find thirty there.\"  He said\, \"Behold\, I have taken upon myself to speak to the Lord. Suppose twenty are found there.\" He answered\, \"For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it.\"  Then he said\, \"Oh let not the Lord be angry\, and I will speak again but this once. Suppose ten are found there.\" He answered\, \"For the sake of ten I will not destroy it.\"  And the LORD went his way\, when he had finished speaking to Abraham; and Abraham returned to his place.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 16:17-17:17\nThe highway of the upright turns aside from evil; he who guards his way preserves his life.  Pride goes before destruction\, and a haughty spirit before a fall.  It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor than to divide the spoil with the proud.  He who gives heed to the word will prosper\, and happy is he who trusts in the LORD.  The wise of heart is called a man of discernment\, and pleasant speech increases persuasiveness.  Wisdom is a fountain of life to him who has it\, but folly is the chastisement of fools.  The mind of the wise makes his speech judicious\, and adds persuasiveness to his lips.  Pleasant words are like a honeycomb\, sweetness to the soul and health to the body.  There is a way which seems right to a man\, but its end is the way to death.  A worker's appetite works for him; his mouth urges him on.  A worthless man plots evil\, and his speech is like a scorching fire.  A perverse man spreads strife\, and a whisperer separates close friends.  A man of violence entices his neighbor and leads him in a way that is not good.  He who winks his eyes plans perverse things\, he who compresses his lips brings evil to pass.  A hoary head is a crown of glory; it is gained in a righteous life.  He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty\, and he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city.  The lot is cast into the lap\, but the decision is wholly from the LORD.\n\n  Better is a dry morsel with quiet than a house full of feasting with strife.  A slave who deals wisely will rule over a son who acts shamefully\, and will share the inheritance as one of the brothers.  The crucible is for silver\, and the furnace is for gold\, and the LORD tries hearts.  An evildoer listens to wicked lips; and a liar gives heed to a mischievous tongue.  He who mocks the poor insults his Maker; he who is glad at calamity will not go unpunished.  Grandchildren are the crown of the aged\, and the glory of sons is their fathers.  Fine speech is not becoming to a fool; still less is false speech to a prince.  A bribe is like a magic stone in the eyes of him who gives it; wherever he turns he prospers.  He who forgives an offense seeks love\, but he who repeats a matter alienates a friend.  A rebuke goes deeper into a man of understanding than a hundred blows into a fool.  An evil man seeks only rebellion\, and a cruel messenger will be sent against him.  Let a man meet a she-bear robbed of her cubs\, rather than a fool in his folly.  If a man returns evil for good\, evil will not depart from his house.  The beginning of strife is like letting out water; so quit before the quarrel breaks out.  He who justifies the wicked and he who condemns the righteous are both alike an abomination to the LORD.  Why should a fool have a price in his hand to buy wisdom\, when he has no mind?  A friend loves at all times\, and a brother is born for adversity.\n\n

SUMMARY:George the Righteous of Maleon
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 04/04/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: George the Righteous of Maleon; Righteous Plato the Studite; Theonas\, Archbishop of Thessaloniki\, Founder and Renovator of the Sacred Monastery of Saint Anastasia of Pharmakolytria\, Halkidiki; Nicetas the Hieromartyr\, Struggler of Serrai (1808); Theodoulos and Agathopous of Thessaloniki; Righteous Zosimas\n\nStrict Fast\n\nOld Testament Reading: Isaiah 45:11-17\nThus says the LORD\, the Holy One of Israel\, and his Maker: \"Will you question me about my children\, or command me concerning the work of my hands?  I made the earth\, and created man upon it; it was my hands that stretched out the heavens\, and I commanded all their host.  I have aroused him in righteousness\, and I will make straight all his ways; he shall build my city and set my exiles free\, not for price or reward\,\" says the LORD of hosts.  \n\n Thus says the LORD: \"The wealth of Egypt and the merchandise of Ethiopia\, and the Sabeans\, men of stature\, shall come over to you and be yours\, they shall follow you; they shall come over in chains and bow down to you. They will make supplication to you\, saying: 'God is with you only\, and there is no other\, no god besides him.'\"  Truly\, thou art a God who hidest thyself\, O God of Israel\, the Savior.  All of them are put to shame and confounded\, the makers of idols go in confusion together.  But Israel is saved by the LORD with everlasting salvation; you shall not be put to shame or confounded to all eternity.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 22:1-18\n After these things God tested Abraham\, and said to him\, \"Abraham!\" And he said\, \"Here am I.\"  He said\, \"Take your son\, your only son Isaac\, whom you love\, and go to the land of Moriah\, and offer him there as a burnt offering upon one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.\"  So Abraham rose early in the morning\, saddled his ass\, and took two of his young men with him\, and his son Isaac; and he cut the wood for the burnt offering\, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him.  On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off.  Then Abraham said to his young men\, \"Stay here with the ass; I and the lad will go yonder and worship\, and come again to you.\"  And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering\, and laid it on Isaac his son; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of them together.  And Isaac said to his father Abraham\, \"My father! \"And he said\, \"Here am I\, my son.\" He said\, \"Behold\, the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?\"  Abraham said\, \"God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering\, my son.\" So they went both of them together.  \n\n When they came to the place of which God had told him\, Abraham built an altar there\, and laid the wood in order\, and bound Isaac his son\, and laid him on the altar\, upon the wood.  Then Abraham put forth his hand\, and took the knife to slay his son.  But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven\, and said\, \"Abraham\, Abraham!\" And he said\, \"Here am I.\"  He said\, \"Do not lay your hand on the lad or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God\, seeing you have not withheld your son\, your only son\, from me.\"  And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked\, and behold\, behind him was a ram\, caught in a thicket by his horns; and Abraham went and took the ram\, and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son.  So Abraham called the name of that place The LORD will provide; as it is said to this day\, \"On the mount of the LORD it shall be provided.\"  And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven\, and said\, \"By myself I have sworn\, says the LORD\, because you have done this\, and have not withheld your son\, your only son\, I will indeed bless you\, and I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is on the seashore. And your descendants shall possess the gate of their enemies\, and by your descendants shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves\, because you have obeyed my voice.\"\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 17:17-18:5\nA friend loves at all times\, and a brother is born for adversity.  A man without sense gives a pledge\, and becomes surety in the presence of his neighbor.  He who loves transgression loves strife; he who makes his door high seeks destruction.  A man of crooked mind does not prosper\, and one with a perverse tongue falls into calamity.  A stupid son is a grief to a father; and the father of a fool has no joy.  A cheerful heart is a good medicine\, but a downcast spirit dries up the bones.  A wicked man accepts a bribe from the bosom to pervert the ways of justice.  A man of understanding sets his face toward wisdom\, but the eyes of a fool are on the ends of the earth.  A foolish son is a grief to his father and bitterness to her who bore him.  To impose a fine on a righteous man is not good; to flog noble men is wrong.  He who restrains his words has knowledge\, and he who has a cool spirit is a man of understanding.  Even a fool who keeps silent is considered wise; when he closes his lips\, he is deemed intelligent.\n\n  He who is estranged seeks pretexts to break out against all sound judgment.  A fool takes no pleasure in understanding\, but only in expressing his opinion.  When wickedness comes\, contempt comes also; and with dishonor comes disgrace.  The words of a man's mouth are deep waters; the fountain of wisdom is a gushing stream.  It is not good to be partial to a wicked man\, or to deprive a righteous man of justice.\n\n

SUMMARY:5th Saturday of Lent: The Akathist Hymn

For a tent was prepared\, the outer one\, in which were the lampstand and the table and the bread of the Presence; it is called the Holy Place. Behind the second curtain stood a tent called the Holy of Holies\, having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold\, which contained a golden urn holding the manna\, and Aaron's rod that budded\, and the tables of the covenant; above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail. These preparations having thus been made\, the priests go continually into the outer tent\, performing their ritual duties; but into the second only the high priest goes\, and he but once a year\, and not without taking blood which he offers for himself and for the errors of the people.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 1:39-49\, 56\nIn those days\, Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country\, to a city of Judah\, and she entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth. And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary\, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and she exclaimed with a loud cry\, \"Blessed are you among women\, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why is this granted me\, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold\, when the voice of your greeting came to my ears\, the babe in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.\"\n\n  And Mary said\, \"My soul magnifies the Lord\, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior\, for he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden. For behold\, henceforth all generations will call me blessed; for he who is mighty has done great things for me\, and holy is his name.\" And Mary remained with her about three months\, and returned to her home.\n\n

SUMMARY:Sunday of St. Mary of Egypt
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 04/06/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Sunday of St. Mary of Egypt; Eutychius\, Patriarch of Constantinople; 120 Martyrs of Persia; Gregory of Sinai; Platonis the Nun of Nisibis\n\nFast Day (Wine and Oil Allowed)\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: John 20:11-18\nAt that time\, Mary stood weeping outside the tomb\, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb\, and she saw two angels in white\, sitting where the body of Jesus has lain\, one at the head and one at the feet. They said to her\, \"Woman\, why are you weeping?\" She said to them\, \"Because they have taken away my Lord\, and I do not know where they have laid Him.\" Saying this\, she turned round and saw Jesus standing\, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her\, \"Woman\, why are you weeping? Whom do you seek?\" Supposing Him to be the gardener\, she said to Him\, \"Sir\, if you have carried Him away\, tell me where you have laid Him\, and I will take Him away.\" Jesus said to her\, \"Mary.\" She turned and said to Him in Hebrew\, \"Rabboni\,\" which means Teacher. Jesus said to her\, \"Do not touch Me\, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brethren and say to them\, I am ascending to My Father and your Father\, to My God and your God.\" Mary Magdalene went and said to the disciples\, \"I have seen the Lord\,\" and she told them that He had said these things to her.\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 9:11-14\nBRETHREN\, when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come\, then through the greater and more perfect tent (not made with hands\, that is\, not of this creation) he entered once for all into the Holy Place\, taking not the blood of goats and calves but his own blood\, thus securing an eternal redemption. For if the sprinkling of defiled persons with the blood of goats and bulls and with the ashes of a heifer sanctifies for the purification of the flesh\, how much more shall the blood of Christ\, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God\, purify your conscience from dead works to serve the living God. \n\nGospel Reading: Mark 10:32-45\nAt that time\, Jesus took his twelve disciples\, and he began to tell them what was to happen to him\, saying\, \"Behold\, we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes\, and they will condemn him to death\, and deliver him to the Gentiles; and they will mock him\, and spit upon him\, and scourge him\, and kill him; and after three days he will rise.\" And James and John\, the sons of Zebedee\, came forward to him\, and said to him\, \"Teacher\, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.\" And he said to them\, \"What do you want me to do for you?\" And they said to him\, \"Grant us to sit\, one at your right hand and one at your left\, in your glory.\" But Jesus said to them\, \"You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink\, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?\" And they said to him\, \"We are able.\" And Jesus said to them\, \"The cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism with which I am baptized\, you will be baptized; but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant\, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.\" And when the ten heard it\, they began to be indignant of James and John. And Jesus called them to him and said to them\, \"You know that those who are supposed to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them\, and their great men exercise authority over them. But it shall not be so among you; but whoever would be great among you must be your servant\, and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all. For the Son of man also came not to be served but to serve\, and to give his life as a ransom for many.\"\n\n

Then your peace would have been like a river\, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea; your offspring would have been like the sand\, and your descendants like its grains; their name would never be cut off or destroyed from before me.\"\n\nGo forth from Babylon\, flee from Chaldea\, declare this with a shout of joy\, proclaim it\, send it forth to the end of the earth; say\, \"The LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob!\"  They thirsted not when he led them through the deserts; he made water flow for them from the rock; he cleft the rock and the water gushed out.  \"There is no peace\,\" says the LORD\, \"for the wicked.\"\n\nListen to me\, O coastlands\, and hearken\, you peoples from afar. The LORD called me from the womb\, from the body of my mother he named my name.  He made my mouth like a sharp sword\, in the shadow of his hand he hid me; he made me a polished arrow\, in his quiver he hid me away.  And he said to me\, \"You are my servant\, Israel\, in whom I will be glorified.\"  But I said\, \"I have labored in vain\, I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity; yet surely my right is with the LORD\, and my recompense with my God.\"\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 27:1-41\nWhen Isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see\, he called Esau his older son\, and said to him\, \"My son\"; and he answered\, \"Here I am.\"  He said\, \"Behold\, I am old; I do not know the day of my death.  Now then\, take your weapons\, your quiver and your bow\, and go out to the field\, and hunt game for me\, and prepare for me savory food\, such as I love\, and bring it to me that I may eat; that I may bless you before I die.\"  Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game and bring it\, Rebekah said to her son Jacob\, \"I heard your father speak to your brother Esau\,  'Bring me game\, and prepare for me savory food\, that I may eat it\, and bless you before the LORD before I die.'  Now therefore\, my son\, obey my word as I command you.  Go to the flock\, and fetch me two good kids\, that I may prepare from them savory food for your father\, such as he loves; and you shall bring it to your father to eat\, so that he may bless you before he dies.\"  But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother\, \"Behold\, my brother Esau is a hairy man\, and I am a smooth man.  Perhaps my father will feel me\, and I shall seem to be mocking him\, and bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing.\"  His mother said to him\, \"Upon me be your curse\, my son; only obey my word\, and go\, fetch them to me.\"  So he went and took them and brought them to his mother; and his mother prepared savory food\, such as his father loved.  Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau her older son\, which were with her in the house\, and put them on Jacob her younger son; and the skins of the kids she put upon his hands and upon the smooth part of his neck; and she gave the savory food and the bread\, which she had prepared\, into the hand of her son Jacob.\n\nSo he went in to his father\, and said\, \"My father\"; and he said\, \"Here I am; who are you\, my son?\"  Jacob said to his father\, \"I am Esau your first-born. I have done as you told me; now sit up and eat of my game\, that you may bless me.\"  But Isaac said to his son\, \"How is it that you have found it so quickly\, my son?\" He answered\, \"Because the LORD your God granted me success.\"  Then Isaac said to Jacob\, \"Come near\, that I may feel you\, my son\, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not.\"  So Jacob went near to Isaac his father\, who felt him and said\, \"The voice is Jacob's voice\, but the hands are the hands of Esau.\"  And he did not recognize him\, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau's hands; so he blessed him.  He said\, \"Are you really my son Esau?\" He answered\, \"I am.\"  Then he said\, \"Bring it to me\, that I may eat of my son's game and bless you.\" So he brought it to him\, and he ate; and he brought him wine\, and he drank.  Then his father Isaac said to him\, \"Come near and kiss me\, my son.\"  So he came near and kissed him; and he smelled the smell of his garments\, and blessed him\, and said\, \"See\, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD has blessed!  May God give you of the dew of heaven\, and of the fatness of the earth\, and plenty of grain and wine.  Let peoples serve you\, and nations bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers\, and may your mother's sons bow down to you. Cursed be every one who curses you\, and blessed be every one who blesses you!\"\n\nAs soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob\, when Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father\, Esau his brother came in from his hunting.  He also prepared savory food\, and brought it to his father. And he said to his father\, \"Let my father arise\, and eat of his son's game\, that you may bless me.\"  His father Isaac said to him\, \"Who are you?\" He answered\, \"I am your son\, your first-born\, Esau.\"  Then Isaac trembled violently\, and said\, \"Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me\, and I ate it all before you came\, and I have blessed him? - Yes\, and he shall be blessed.\"  When Esau heard the words of his father\, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry\, and said to his father\, \"Bless me\, even me also\, O my father!\"  But he said\, \"Your brother came with guile\, and he has taken away your blessing.\"  Esau said\, \"Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright; and behold\, now he has taken away my blessing.\" Then he said\, \"Have you not reserved a blessing for me?\"  Isaac answered Esau\, \"Behold\, I have made him your lord\, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants\, and with grain and wine I have sustained him. What then can I do for you\, my son?\"  Esau said to his father\, \"Have you but one blessing\, my father? Bless me\, even me also\, O my father.\" And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.  Then Isaac his father answered him: \"Behold\, away from the fatness of the earth shall your dwelling be\, and away from the dew of heaven on high.  By your sword you shall live\, and you shall serve your brother; but when you break loose you shall break his yoke from your neck.\"  Now Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him\, and Esau said to himself\, \"The days of mourning for my father are approaching; then I will kill my brother Jacob.\"\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 19:16-25\nHe who keeps the commandment keeps his life; he who despises the word will die.  He who is kind to the poor lends to the LORD\, and he will repay him for his deed.  Discipline your son while there is hope; do not set your heart on his destruction.  A man of great wrath will pay the penalty; for if you deliver him\, you will only have to do it again.  Listen to advice and accept instruction\, that you may gain wisdom for the future.  Many are the plans in the mind of a man\, but it is the purpose of the LORD that will be established.  What is desired in a man is loyalty\, and a poor man is better than a liar.  The fear of the LORD leads to life; and he who has it rests satisfied; he will not be visited by harm.  The sluggard buries his hand in the dish\, and will not even bring it back to his mouth.  Strike a scoffer\, and the simple will learn prudence; reprove a man of understanding\, and he will gain knowledge.\n\n

SUMMARY:The Holy Apostles of the Seventy Herodion\, Agabus\, Rufus\, Asyncritus\, Phlegon\, and Hermes
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 04/08/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: The Holy Apostles of the Seventy Herodion\, Agabus\, Rufus\, Asyncritus\, Phlegon\, and Hermes; The Holy New Martyr John the Ship-Builder who was martyred in Kos; Rufus the Obedient of the Kiev Caves; Celestine\, Pope of Rome\n\nStrict Fast\n\nOld Testament Reading: Isaiah 49:6-10\nThus says the LORD: \"I will give you as a light to the nations\, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.\"  Thus says the LORD\, the Redeemer of Israel and his Holy One\, to one deeply despised\, abhorred by the nations\, the servant of rulers: \"Kings shall see and arise; princes\, and they shall prostrate themselves; because of the LORD\, who is faithful\, the Holy One of Israel\, who has chosen you.\"  Thus says the LORD: \"In a time of favor I have answered you\, in a day of salvation I have helped you; I have kept you and given you as a covenant to the people\, to establish the land\, to apportion the desolate heritages; saying to the prisoners\, 'Come forth\,' to those who are in darkness\, 'Appear.' They shall feed along the ways\, on all bare heights shall be their pasture; they shall not hunger or thirst\, neither scorching wind nor sun shall smite them\, for he who has pity on them will lead them\, and by springs of water will guide them.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 31:3-16\n Then the LORD said to Jacob\, \"Return to the land of your fathers and to your kindred\, and I will be with you.\"  So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah into the field where his flock was\, and said to them\, \"I see that your father does not regard me with favor as he did before. But the God of my father has been with me.  You know that I have served your father with all my strength; yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times\, but God did not permit him to harm me.  If he said\, 'The spotted shall be your wages\,' then all the flock bore spotted; and if he said\, 'The striped shall be your wages\,' then all the flock bore striped.  Thus God has taken away the cattle of your father\, and given them to me.  In the mating season of the flock I lifted up my eyes\, and saw in a dream that the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were striped\, spotted\, and mottled.  Then the angel of God said to me in the dream\, 'Jacob\,' and I said\, 'Here I am!'  And he said\, 'Lift up your eyes and see\, all the goats that leap upon the flock are striped\, spotted\, and mottled; for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you.  I am the God of Bethel\, where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me. Now arise\, go forth from this land\, and return to the land of your birth.'\"  Then Rachel and Leah answered him\, \"Is there any portion or inheritance left to us in our father's house?  Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold us\, and he has been using up the money given for us.  All the property which God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children; now then\, whatever God has said to you\, do.\"\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 21:3-21\nTo do righteousness and justice is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.  Haughty eyes and a proud heart\, the lamp of the wicked\, are sin.  The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance\, but every one who is hasty comes only to want.  The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor and a snare of death.  The violence of the wicked will sweep them away\, because they refuse to do what is just.  The way of the guilty is crooked\, but the conduct of the pure is right.  It is better to live in a corner of the housetop than in a house shared with a contentious woman.  The soul of the wicked desires evil; his neighbor finds no mercy in his eyes.  When a scoffer is punished\, the simple becomes wise; when a wise man is instructed\, he gains knowledge.  The righteous observes the house of the wicked; the wicked are cast down to ruin.  He who closes his ear to the cry of the poor will himself cry out and not be heard.  A gift in secret averts anger; and a bribe in the bosom\, strong wrath.  When justice is done\, it is a joy to the righteous\, but dismay to evildoers.  A man who wanders from the way of understanding will rest in the assembly of the dead.  He who loves pleasure will be a poor man; he who loves wine and oil will not be rich.  The wicked is a ransom for the righteous\, and the faithless for the upright.  It is better to live in a desert land than with a contentious and fretful woman.  Precious treasure remains in a wise man's dwelling\, but a foolish man devours it.  He who pursues righteousness and kindness will find life and honor.\n\n

SUMMARY:The Holy Martyr Eupsychius of Caesarea
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 04/09/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: The Holy Martyr Eupsychius of Caesarea; Raphael\, Nicholas\, Irene\, & Olympias of Mytilene; Vadim the Righteous of Persia\n\nStrict Fast\n\nOld Testament Reading: Isaiah 58:1-11\nThus says the LORD: \"Cry aloud\, spare not\, lift up your voice like a trumpet; declare to my people their transgression\, to the house of Jacob their sins.  Yet they seek me daily\, and delight to know my ways\, as if they were a nation that did righteousness and did not forsake the ordinance of their God; they ask of me righteous judgments\, they delight to draw near to God.  'Why have we fasted\, and thou seest it not? Why have we humbled ourselves\, and thou takest no knowledge of it?' Behold\, in the day of your fast you seek your own pleasure\, and oppress all your workers.  Behold\, you fast only to quarrel and to fight and to hit with wicked fist. Fasting like yours this day will not make your voice to be heard on high.  Is such the fast that I choose\, a day for a man to humble himself? Is it to bow down his head like a rush\, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Will you call this a fast\, and a day acceptable to the LORD?  \n\n \"Is not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of wickedness\, to undo the thongs of the yoke\, to let the oppressed go free\, and to break every yoke?  Is it not to share your bread with the hungry\, and bring the homeless poor into your house; when you see the naked\, to cover him\, and not to hide yourself from your own flesh?  Then shall your light break forth like the dawn\, and your healing shall spring up speedily; your righteousness shall go before you\, the glory of the LORD shall be your rear guard.  Then you shall call\, and the LORD will answer; you shall cry\, and he will say\, \"Here I am.\" \n\n \"If you take away from the midst of you the yoke\, the pointing of the finger\, and speaking wickedness\, if you pour yourself out for the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted\, then shall your light rise in the darkness and your gloom be as the noonday.  And the LORD will guide you continually\, and satisfy your desire with good things\, and make your bones strong; and you shall be like a watered garden\, like a spring of water\, whose waters fail not.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 43:26-31; 45:1-16\n When Joseph came home\, they brought into the house to him the present which they had with them\, and bowed down to him to the ground.  And he inquired about their welfare\, and said\, \"Is your father well\, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?\"  They said\, \"Your servant our father is well\, he is still alive.\" And they bowed their heads and made obeisance.  And he lifted up his eyes\, and saw his brother Benjamin\, his mother's son\, and said\, \"Is this your youngest brother\, of whom you spoke to me? God be gracious to you\, my son!\"  Then Joseph made haste\, for his heart yearned for his brother\, and he sought a place to weep. And he entered his chamber and wept there.  Then he washed his face and came out; and controlling himself he said\, \"Let food be served.\" \n\n (Chapter 45:1-16) Then Joseph could not control himself before all those who stood by him; and he cried\, \"Make every one go out from me.\" So no one stayed with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers.  And he wept aloud\, so that the Egyptians heard it\, and the household of Pharaoh heard it.  And Joseph said to his brothers\, \"I am Joseph; is my father still alive?\" But his brothers could not answer him\, for they were dismayed at his presence.  So Joseph said to his brothers\, \"Come near to me\, I pray you.\" And they came near. And he said\, \"I am your brother\, Joseph\, whom you sold into Egypt.  And now do not be distressed\, or angry with yourselves\, because you sold me here; for God sent me before you to preserve life.  For the famine has been in the land these two years; and there are yet five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest.  And God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on earth\, and to keep alive for you many survivors.  So it was not you who sent me here\, but God; and he has made me a father to Pharaoh\, and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt.  Make haste and go up to my father and say to him\, 'Thus says your son Joseph\, God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me\, do not tarry; you shall dwell in the land of Goshen\, and you shall be near me\, you and your children and your children's children\, and your flocks\, your herds\, and all that you have; and there I will provide for you\, for there are yet five years of famine to come; lest you and your household\, and all that you have\, come to poverty.'  And now your eyes see\, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see\, that it is my mouth that speaks to you.  You must tell my father of all my splendor in Egypt\, and of all that you have seen. Make haste and bring my father down here.\"  Then he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.  And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them; and after that his brothers talked with him.  When the report was heard in Pharaoh's house\, \"Joseph's brothers have come\,\" it pleased Pharaoh and his servants well.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 21:23-22:4\nHe who keeps his mouth and his tongue keeps himself out of trouble.  \"Scoffer\" is the name of the proud\, haughty man who acts with arrogant pride.  The desire of the sluggard kills him for his hands refuse to labor.  All day long the wicked covets\, but the righteous gives and does not hold back.  The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination; how much more when he brings it with evil intent.  A false witness will perish\, but the word of a man who hears will endure.  A wicked man puts on a bold face\, but an upright man considers his ways.  No wisdom\, no understanding\, no counsel\, can avail against the LORD.  The horse is made ready for the day of battle\, but the victory belongs to the LORD.  A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches\, and favor is better than silver or gold.  The rich and the poor meet together; the LORD is the maker of them all.  A prudent man sees danger and hides himself; but the simple go on\, and suffer for it.  The reward for humility and fear of the LORD is riches and honor and life.\n\n

SUMMARY:Terence and his Companions beheaded at Carthage
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 04/10/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Terence and his Companions beheaded at Carthage; 150 and more Righteous Martyr Fathers of the Sacred Monastery of Pantocrator Daou Pentelis; Gregory V\, the Holy Martyr and Patriarch of Constantinople; Holy Father Theonas\, Archbishop of Thessolonica; Miltiades\, Pope of Rome\n\nStrict Fast\n\nOld Testament Reading: Isaiah 65:8-16\nThus says the LORD: \"As the wine is found in the cluster\, and they say\, 'Do not destroy it\, for there is a blessing in it\,' so I will do for my servants' sake\, and not destroy them all.  I will bring forth descendants from Jacob\, and from Judah inheritors of my mountains; my chosen shall inherit it\, and my servants shall dwell there.  Sharon shall become a pasture for flocks\, and the Valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down\, for my people who have sought me.  But you who forsake the LORD\, who forget my holy mountain\, who set a table for Fortune and fill cups of mixed wine for Destiny; I will destine you to the sword\, and all of you shall bow down to the slaughter; because\, when I called\, you did not answer\, when I spoke\, you did not listen\, but you did what was evil in my eyes\, and chose what I did not delight in.\"  Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: \"Behold\, my servants shall eat\, but you shall be hungry; behold\, my servants shall drink\, but you shall be thirsty; behold\, my servants shall rejoice\, but you shall be put to shame; behold\, my servants shall sing for gladness of heart\, but you shall cry out for pain of heart\, and shall wail for anguish of spirit.  You shall leave your name to my chosen for a curse\, and the Lord GOD will slay you; but his servants he will call by a different name.  So that he who blesses himself in the land shall bless himself by the God of truth\, and he who takes an oath in the land shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten and are hid from my eyes.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 46:1-7\n So Israel took his journey with all that he had\, and came to Beersheba\, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.  And God spoke to Israel in visions of the night\, and said\, \"Jacob\, Jacob.\" And he said\, \"Here am I.\"  Then he said\, \"I am God\, the God of your father; do not be afraid to go down to Egypt; for I will there make of you a great nation.  I will go down with you to Egypt\, and I will also bring you up again; and Joseph's hand shall close your eyes.\"  Then Jacob set out from Beersheba; and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father\, their little ones\, and their wives\, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.  They also took their cattle and their goods\, which they had gained in the land of Canaan\, and came into Egypt\, Jacob and all his offspring with him\, his sons\, and his sons' sons with him\, his daughters\, and his sons' daughters; all his offspring he brought with him into Egypt.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 23:15-24:5\nMy son\, if your heart is wise\, my heart too will be glad.  My soul will rejoice when your lips speak what is right.  Let not your heart envy sinners\, but continue in the fear of the LORD all the day.  Surely there is a future\, and your hope will not be cut off.  Hear\, my son\, and be wise\, and direct your mind in the way.  Be not among winebibbers\, or among gluttonous eaters of meat; for the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty\, and drowsiness will clothe a man with rags.  Hearken to your father who begot you\, and do not despise your mother when she is old.  Buy truth\, and do not sell it; buy wisdom\, instruction\, and understanding.  The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice; he who begets a wise son will be glad in him.  Let your father and mother be glad\, let her who bore you rejoice.  My son\, give me your heart\, and let your eyes observe my ways.  For a harlot is a deep pit; an adventuress is a narrow well.  She lies in wait like a robber and increases the faithless among men.  Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaining? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes?  Those who tarry long over wine\, those who go to try mixed wine.  Do not look at wine when it is red\, when it sparkles in the cup and goes down smoothly.  At the last it bites like a serpent\, and stings like an adder.  Your eyes will see strange things\, and your mind utter perverse things.  You will be like one who lies down in the midst of the sea\, like one who lies on the top of a mast.  \"They struck me\,\" you will say\, \"but I was not hurt; they beat me\, but I did not feel it. When shall I awake? I will seek another drink.\"  Be not envious of evil men\, nor desire to be with them; for their minds devise violence\, and their lips talk of mischief.  By wisdom a house is built\, and by understanding it is established; by knowledge the rooms are filled with all precious and pleasant riches.  A wise man is mightier than a strong man\, and a man of knowledge than he who has strength.\n\n

SUMMARY:Hieromartyr Antipas\, Bishop of Pergamum
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 04/11/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Hieromartyr Antipas\, Bishop of Pergamum; Pharmuthios the Anchorite; Guthlac the Hermit of Crowland\n\nStrict Fast\n\nOld Testament Reading: Isaiah 66:10-24\n\"Rejoice with Jerusalem\, and be glad for her\, all you who love her; rejoice with her in joy\, all you who mourn over her; that you may suck and be satisfied with her consoling breasts; that you may drink deeply with delight from the abundance of her glory.\"  For thus says the LORD: \"Behold\, I will extend prosperity to her like a river\, and the wealth of the nations like an overflowing stream; and you shall suck\, you shall be carried upon her hip\, and dandled upon her knees.  As one whom his mother comforts\, so I will comfort you; you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.  You shall see\, and your heart shall rejoice; your bones shall flourish like the grass; and it shall be known that the hand of the LORD is with his servants\, and his indignation is against his enemies.  \"For behold\, the LORD will come in fire\, and his chariots like the stormwind\, to render his anger in fury\, and his rebuke with flames of fire.  For by fire will the LORD execute judgment\, and by his sword\, upon all flesh; and those slain by the LORD shall be many.  \"Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go into the gardens\, following one in the midst\, eating swine's flesh and the abomination and mice\, shall come to an end together\, says the LORD.  \"For I know their works and their thoughts\, and I am coming to gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come and shall see my glory\, and I will set a sign among them. And from them I will send survivors to the nations\, to Tarshish\, Put\, and Lud\, who draw the bow\, to Tubal and Javan\, to the coastlands afar off\, that have not heard my fame or seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the nations.  And they shall bring all your brethren from all the nations as an offering to the LORD\, upon horses\, and in chariots\, and in litters\, and upon mules\, and upon dromedaries\, to my holy mountain Jerusalem\, says the LORD\, just as the Israelites bring their cereal offering in a clean vessel to the house of the LORD.  And some of them also I will take for priests and for Levites\, says the LORD.  \"For as the new heavens and the new earth which I will make shall remain before me\, says the LORD; so shall your descendants and your name remain.  From new moon to new moon\, and from sabbath to sabbath\, all flesh shall come to worship before me\, says the LORD.  \"And they shall go forth and look on the dead bodies of the men that have rebelled against me; for their worm shall not die\, their fire shall not be quenched\, and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.\"\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 49:33-50:26\nWhen Jacob finished charging his sons\, he drew up his feet into the bed\, and breathed his last\, and was gathered to his people.  Then Joseph fell on his father's face\, and wept over him\, and kissed him.  And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel; forty days were required for it\, for so many are required for embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days.\n\nAnd when the days of weeping for him were past\, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh\, saying\, \"If now I have found favor in your eyes\, speak\, I pray you\, in the ears of Pharaoh\, saying\, My father made me swear\, saying\, 'I am about to die: in my tomb which I hewed out for myself in the land of Canaan\, there shall you bury me.' Now therefore let me go up\, I pray you\, and bury my father; then I will return.\"  And Pharaoh answered\, \"Go up\, and bury your father\, as he made you swear.\"  So Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh\, the elders of his household\, and all the elders of the land of Egypt\, as well as all the household of Joseph\, his brothers\, and his father's household; only their children\, their flocks\, and their herds were left in the land of Goshen.  And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen; it was a very great company.  When they came to the threshing floor of Atad\, which is beyond the Jordan\, they lamented there with a very great and sorrowful lamentation; and he made a mourning for his father seven days.  When the inhabitants of the land\, the Canaanites\, saw the mourning on the threshing floor of Atad\, they said\, \"This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians.\" Therefore the place was named Abelmizraim; it is beyond the Jordan.  Thus his sons did for him as he had commanded them; for his sons carried him to the land of Canaan\, and buried him in the cave of the field at Machpelah\, to the east of Mamre\, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite\, to possess as a burying place.  After he had buried his father\, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father.  When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead\, they said\, \"It may be that Joseph will hate us and pay us back for all the evil which we did to him.\"  So they sent a message to Joseph\, saying\, \"Your father gave this command before he died\,  'Say to Joseph\, Forgive\, I pray you\, the transgression of your brothers and their sin\, because they did evil to you.' And now\, we pray you\, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.\" Joseph wept when they spoke to him.  His brothers also came and fell down before him\, and said\, \"Behold\, we are your servants.\"  But Joseph said to them\, \"Fear not\, for am I in the place of God?  As for you\, you meant evil against me; but God meant it for good\, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive\, as they are today.  So do not fear; I will provide for you and your little ones.\" Thus he reassured them and comforted them.\n\nSo Joseph dwelt in Egypt\, he and his father's house; and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.  And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation; the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were born upon Joseph's knees.  And Joseph said to his brothers\, \"I am about to die; but God will visit you\, and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham\, to Isaac\, and to Jacob.\"  Then Joseph took an oath of the sons of Israel\, saying\, \"God will visit you\, and you shall carry up my bones from here.\"  So Joseph died\, being a hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him\, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 31:8-31\nOpen your mouth for the dumb\, for the rights of all who are left desolate.  Open your mouth\, judge righteously\, maintain the rights of the poor and needy.  A good wife who can find? She is far more precious than jewels.  The heart of her husband trusts in her\, and he will have no lack of gain.  She does him good\, and not harm\, all the days of her life.  She seeks wool and flax\, and works with willing hands.  She is like the ships of the merchant\, she brings her food from afar.  She rises while it is yet night and provides food for her household and tasks for her maidens.  She considers a field and buys it; with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.  She girds her loins with strength and makes her arms strong.  She perceives that her merchandise is profitable. Her lamp does not go out at night.  She puts her hands to the distaff\, and her hands hold the spindle.  She opens her hand to the poor\, and reaches out her hands to the needy.  She is not afraid of snow for her household\, for all her household are clothed in scarlet.  She makes herself coverings; her clothing is fine linen and purple.  Her husband is known in the gates\, when he sits among the elders of the land.  She makes linen garments and sells them; she delivers girdles to the merchant.  Strength and dignity are her clothing\, and she laughs at the time to come.  She opens her mouth with wisdom\, and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue.  She looks well to the ways of her household\, and does not eat the bread of idleness.  Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband also\, and he praises her:  \"Many women have done excellently\, but you surpass them all.\"  Charm is deceitful\, and beauty is vain\, but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.  Give her of the fruit of her hands\, and let her works praise her in the gates.\n\n

SUMMARY:Lazarus Saturday
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 04/12/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Lazarus Saturday; Basil the Confessor\, Bishop of Parium; Sergius II\, Patriarch of Constantinople; Anthousa the Righteous of Constantinople; Akakios of Kavsokalyvia\n\nFast Day (Wine and Oil Allowed)\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 12:28-29;13:1-8\nBRETHREN\, let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken\, and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship\, with reverence and awe; for our God is a consuming fire. Let brotherly love continue. Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers\, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. Remember those who are in prison\, as though in prison with them; and those who are ill-treated\, since you also are in the body. Let marriage be held in honor among all\, and let the marriage bed be undefiled; for God will judge the immoral and adulterous. Keep your life free from love of money\, and be content with what you have; for he has said\, \"I will never fail you nor forsake you.\" Hence we can confidently say\, \"The Lord is my helper\, I will not be afraid; what can man do to me?\" Remember your leaders\, those who spoke to you the word of God; consider the outcome of their life\, and imitate their faith. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and for ever. \n\nGospel Reading: John 11:1-45\nAt that time\, a certain man was ill\, Lazaros of Bethany\, from the village of Mary and her sister Martha. It was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair\, whose brother Lazaros was ill. So the sisters sent to him\, saying\, \"Lord\, he whom you love is ill.\" But when Jesus heard it he said\, \"This illness is not unto death; it is for the glory of God\, so that the Son of God may be glorified by means of it.\"\n\n Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazaros. So when he heard that he was ill\, he stayed two days longer in the place where he was. Then after this he said to the disciples\, \"Let us go into Judea again.\" The disciples said to him\, \"Rabbi\, the Jews were but now seeking to stone you\, and are you going there again?\" Jesus answered\, \"Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any one walks in the day\, he does not stumble\, because he sees the light of this world. But if any one walks in the night\, he stumbles\, because the light is not in him.\" Thus he spoke\, and then he said to them\, \"Our friend Lazaros has fallen asleep\, but I go to awake him out of sleep.\" The disciples said to him\, \"Lord\, if he has fallen asleep\, he will recover.\" Now Jesus had spoken of his death\, but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep. Then Jesus told them plainly\, \"Lazaros is dead; and for your sake I am glad that I was not there\, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.\" Thomas\, called the Twin\, said to his fellow disciples\, \"Let us also go\, that we may die with him.\"\n\n Now when Jesus came\, he found that Lazaros had already been in the tomb four days. Bethany was near Jerusalem\, about two miles off\, and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother. When Martha heard that Jesus was coming\, she went and met him\, while Mary sat in the house. Martha said to Jesus\, \"Lord\, if you had been here\, my brother would not have died. And even now I know that whatever you ask from God\, God will give you.\" Jesus said to her\, \"Your brother will rise again.\" Martha said to him\, \"I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.\" Jesus said to her\, \"I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in me\, though he die\, yet shall he live\, and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?\" She said to him\, \"Yes\, Lord; I believe that you are the Christ\, the Son of God\, he who is coming into the world.\"\n\n When she had said this\, she went and called her sister Mary\, saying quietly\, \"The Teacher is here and is calling for you.\" And when she heard it\, she rose quickly and went to him. Now Jesus had not yet come to the village\, but was still in the place where Martha had met him. When the Jews who were with her in the house\, consoling her\, saw Mary rise quickly and go out\, they followed her\, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there. Then Mary\, when she came where Jesus was and saw him\, fell at his feet\, saying to him\, \"Lord\, if you had been here\, my brother would not have died.\" When Jesus saw her weeping\, and the Jews who came with her also weeping\, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled; and he said\, \"Where have you laid him?\" They said to him\, \"Lord\, come and see.\" Jesus wept. So the Jews said\, \"See how he loved him!\" But some of them said\, \"Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?\"\n\n Then Jesus\, deeply moved again\, came to the tomb; it was a cave\, and a stone lay upon it. Jesus said\, \"Take away the stone.\" Martha\, the sister of the dead man\, said to him\, \"Lord\, by this time there will be an odor\, for he has been dead four days.\" Jesus said to her\, \"Did I not tell you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?\" So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said\, \"Father\, I thank you that you have heard me. I knew that you have heard me always\, but I have said this on account of the people standing by\, that they may believe that you did send me.\" When he had said this\, he cried with a loud voice\, \"Lazaros\, come out.\" The dead man came out\, his hands and feet bound with bandages\, and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them\, \"Unbind him\, and let him go.\" Many of the Jews therefore\, who had come with Mary and had seen what he did\, believed in him.\n\n

SUMMARY:Palm Sunday
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 04/13/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Palm Sunday; Martin the Confessor\, Pope of Rome; Theodosios the Martyr; Zoilos the Martyr\n\nFast Day (Fish Allowed)\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Matthew 21:1-11; 15-17\nAt that time\, when Jesus drew near to  Jerusalem and came to Bethphage\, to the Mount of Olives\, he sent two disciples\, saying to them\, \"Go into the village opposite you\, and immediately you will find a donkey tied\, and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me. If any one says anything to you\, you shall say\, 'The Lord has need of them\,' and he will send them immediately.\" This took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet\, saying\,\n\n\"Tell the daughter of Zion\,\nBehold\, your king is coming to you\,\nhumble and mounted on a donkey\,\nand on a colt\, the foal of a donkey.\"\n\nThe disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them; they brought the donkey and the colt\, and put their garments on them\, and he sat thereon. Most of the crowd spread their garments on the road\, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. And the crowds that went before him and that followed him shouted\, \"Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!\" And when he entered Jerusalem\, all the city was stirred\, saying\, \"Who is this?\" And the crowds said\, \"This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee.\" But when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did\, and the children crying out in the temple\, \"Hosanna to the Son of David!\" they were indignant; and they said to him\, \"Do you hear what they are saying?\" And Jesus said to them\, \"Yes; have you never read\,\n\n'Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings\,\nyou have brought perfect praise'?\"\n\nAnd leaving them\, he went out of the city to Bethany and lodged there.\n\nEpistle Reading: Philippians 4:4-9\nBRETHREN\, rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say\, Rejoice. Let all men know your forbearance. The Lord is at hand. Have no anxiety about anything\, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God\, which passes all understanding\, will keep your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Finally\, brethren\, whatever is true\, whatever is honorable\, whatever is just\, whatever is pure\, whatever is lovely\, whatever is gracious\, if there is any excellence\, if there is anything worthy of praise\, think about these things. What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me\, do; and the God of peace will be with you. \n\nGospel Reading: John 12:1-18\nSix days before Passover\, Jesus came to Bethany\, where Lazaros was\, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. There they made him a supper; Martha served\, and Lazaros was one of those at table with him. Mary took a pound of costly ointment of pure nard and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment. But Judas Iscariot\, one of his disciples (he who was to betray him)\, said \"Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?\" This he said\, not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief\, and as he had the money box he used to take what was put into it. Jesus said\, \"Let her alone\, let her keep it for the day of my burial. The poor you always have with you\, but you do not always have me.\"\n\n When the great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there\, they came\, not only on account of Jesus but also to see Lazaros\, whom he had raised from the dead. So the chief priests planned to put Lazaros also to death\, because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.\n\n The next day a great crowd who had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him\, crying\, \"Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord\, even the King of Israel!\" And Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it; as it is written\, \"Fear not\, daughter of Zion; behold\, your king is coming\, sitting on a donkey's colt!\" His disciples did not understand this at first; but when Jesus was glorified\, then they remembered that this had been written of him and had been done to him. The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazaros out of the tomb and raised him from the dead bore witness. The reason why the crowd went to meet him was that they heard he had done this sign.\n\n

SUMMARY:Holy Monday
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 04/14/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Holy Monday; Aristarchus\, Pudens\, Trophimus the Apostles of the 70; Thomais the Martyr of Alexandria; Ardalion the Actor and Martyr; Demetrios the New-Martyr of Arcadia\n\nStrict Fast\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 21:18-43\nAt that time\, as Jesus was returning to the city\, he was hungry. And seeing a fig tree by the wayside he went to it\, and found nothing on it but leaves only. And he said to it\, \"May no fruit ever come from you again!\" And the fig tree withered at once. When the disciples saw it they marveled\, saying\, \"How did the fig tree wither at once?\" And Jesus answered them\, \"Truly\, I say to you\, if you have faith and never doubt\, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree\, but even if you say to this mountain\, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea\,' it will be done. And whatever you ask in prayer\, you will receive\, if you have faith. \" And when he entered the temple\, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching\, and said\, \"By what authority are you doing these things\, and who gave you this authority?\" Jesus answered them\, \"I also will ask you a question; and if you tell me the answer\, then I also will tell you by what authority I do these things. The baptism of John\, whence was it? From heaven or from men?\" And they argued with one another\, \"If we say\, 'From heaven\,' he will say to us\, 'Why then did you not believe him?' But if we say\, 'From men\,' we are afraid of the multitude; for all hold that John was a prophet.\" So they answered Jesus\, \"We do not know.\" And he said to them\, \"Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things. What do you think? A man had two sons; and he went to the first and said\, 'Son\, go and work in the vineyard today.' And he answered\, 'I will not'; but afterward he repented and went. And he went to the second and said the same; and he answered\, 'I go\, sir\,' but did not go. Which of the two did the will of his father?\" They said\, \"The first.\" Jesus said to them\, \"Truly\, I say to you\, the tax collectors and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. For John came to you in the way of righteousness\, and you did not believe him\, but the tax collectors and the harlots believed him; and even when you saw it\, you did not afterward repent and believe him.\n\n\"Hear another parable. There was a householder who planted a vineyard and set a hedge around it\, and dug a wine press in it\, and built a tower\, and let it out to tenants\, and went into another country. When the season of fruit drew near\, he sent his servants to the tenants\, to get his fruit; and the tenants took his servants and beat one\, killed another\, and stoned another. Again he sent other servants\, more than the first; and they did the same to them. Afterward he sent his son to them\, saying\, 'They will respect my son.' But when the tenants saw the son\, they said to themselves\, 'This is the heir; come\, let us kill him and have his inheritance.' And they took him and cast him out of the vineyard\, and killed him. When therefore the owner of the vineyard comes\, what will he do to those tenants?\" They said to him\, \"He will put those wretches to a miserable death\, and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons.\" Jesus said to them\, \"Have you never read in the scriptures: 'The very stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner; this was the Lord's doing\, and it is marvelous in our eyes'? Therefore I tell you\, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation producing the fruits of it.\"\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 24:3-35\nAt that time\, as Jesus sat on the Mount of Olives\, the disciples came to him privately\, saying\, \"Tell us\, when will this be\, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the close of the age?\" And Jesus answered them\, \"Take heed that no one leads you astray. For many will come in my name\, saying\, 'I am the Christ\,' and they will lead many astray. And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that you are not alarmed; for this must take place\, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation\, and kingdom against kingdom\, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places: all this is but the beginning of the sufferings.\n\n Then they will deliver you up to tribulation\, and put you to death; and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake. And then many will fall away\, and betray one another\, and hate one another. And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. And because wickedness is multiplied\, most men's love will grow cold. But he who endures to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world\, as a testimony to all nations; and then the end will come.\n\n So when you see the desolating sacrilege spoken of by the prophet Daniel\, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand)\, then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains; let him who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house; and let him who is in the field not turn back to take his mantle. And alas for those who are with child and for those who give suck in those days! Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a sabbath. For then there will be great tribulation\, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now\, no\, and never will be. And if those days had not been shortened\, no human being would be saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened. Then if anyone says to you\, 'Lo\, here is the Christ!' or 'There he is!' do not believe it. For false Christs and false prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders\, so as to lead astray\, if possible\, even the elect. Lo\, I have told you beforehand. So\, if they say to you\, 'Lo\, he is in the wilderness\,' do not go out; if they say\, 'Lo\, he is in the inner rooms\,' do not believe it. For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west\, so will be the coming of the Son of man. Wherever the body is\, there the eagles will be gathered together. Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened\, and the moon will not give its light\, and the stars will fall from heaven\, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken; then will appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven\, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn\, and they will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory; and he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call\, and they will gather his elect from the four winds\, from one end of heaven to the other.\n\n From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves\, you know that summer is near. So also\, when you see all these things\, you know that he is near\, at the very gates. Truly\, I say to you\, this generation will not pass away till all these things take place. Heaven and earth will pass away\, but my words will not pass away.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Holy Tuesday
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 04/15/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Holy Tuesday; Crescens the Martyr; Leonidas\, Bishop of Athens; Michael the New Martyr of Smyrna; The 9 Monk-martyrs of Corinth; Padarn\, Bishop and Founder of Llandabarn Fawr\n\nStrict Fast\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 22:15-46; 23:1-39\nAt that time\, the Pharisees went and took counsel against Jesus\, how to entangle him in his talk. And they sent their disciples to him\, along with the Herodians\, saying\, \"Teacher\, we know that you are true\, and teach the way of God truthfully\, and care for no man; for you do not regard the position of men. Tell us\, then\, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar\, or not?\" But Jesus\, aware of their malice\, said\, \"Why put me to the test\, you hypocrites? Show me the money for the tax.\" And they brought him a coin. And Jesus said to them\, \"Whose likeness and inscription is this?\" They said\, \"Caesar's.\" Then he said to them\, \"Render\, therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's\, and to God the things that are God's. \" When they heard it\, they marveled; and they left him and went away.\n\nThe same day the Sadducees came to him\, who say that there is no resurrection; and they asked him a question saying\, \"Teacher\, Moses said\, 'If a man dies\, having no children\, his brother must marry the widow\, and raise up children for his brother.' Now there were seven brothers among us; the first married\, and died\, and having no children left his wife to his brother. So too the second and third\, down to the seventh. After them all\, the woman died. In the resurrection\, therefore\, to which of the seven will she be wife? For they all had her.\"\n\nBut Jesus answered them\, \"You are wrong\, because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God. For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage\, but are like angels of God in heaven. And as for the resurrection of the dead\, have you not read what was said to you by God\, 'I am the God of Abraham\, and the God of Isaac\, and the God of Jacob'? He is not God of the dead\, but of the living.\" And when the crowd heard it\, they were astonished at his teaching.\n\nBut when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees\, they came together. And one of them\, a lawyer\, asked him a question\, to test him. \"Teacher\, which is the great commandment in the law?\" And he said to him\, \"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart\, and with all your soul\, and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it. You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets.\"\n\nNow while the Pharisees were gathered together\, Jesus asked them a question\, saying: \"What do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?\" They said to him\, \"The son of David.\" He said to them\, \"How is it then that David\, inspired by the Spirit\, calls him Lord\, saying\, 'The Lord said to my Lord\, sit at my right hand\, till I put your enemies under your feet'? If David thus calls him Lord\, how is he his son?\" And no one was able to answer him a word\, nor from that day did any one dare to ask him any more questions.\n\nThen said Jesus to the crowds and to his disciples\, \"The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat; so practice and observe whatever they tell you\, but not what they do; for they preach but do not practice. They bind heavy burdens\, hard to bear\, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with their finger. They do all their deeds to be seen by men; for they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long\, and they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues\, and salutations in the market places\, and being called rabbi by men\, but you are not to be called rabbi\, for you have one teacher\, and you are all brethren. And call no man your father on earth\, for you have one Father\, who is in heaven. Neither be called masters\, for you have one master\, the Christ. He who is greatest among you shall be your servant; whoever exalts himself will be humbled\, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.\n\n\"But woe to you\, scribes and Pharisees\, hypocrites! for you devour widows' houses and for a pretense you make long prayers; therefore you will receive the greater condemnation. Woe to you\, scribes and Pharisees\, hypocrites! because you shut the kingdom of heaven against men; for you neither enter yourselves\, nor allow those who would enter to go in. Woe to you\, scribes and Pharisees\, hypocrites! for you traverse sea and land to make a single proselyte\, and when he becomes a proselyte\, you make him twice as much a child of Gehenna as yourselves.\n\n\"Woe to you\, blind guides\, who say\, 'If any one swears by the temple\, it is nothing; but if any one swears by the gold of the temple\, he is bound by his oath.' You blind fools! For which is greater\, the gold or the temple that has made the gold sacred? And you say\, 'If any one swears by the altar\, it is nothing; but if any one swears by the gift that is on the altar\, he is bound by his oath.' You blind men! For which is greater\, the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred? So he who swears by the altar\, swears by it and by everything on it; and he who swears by the temple\, swears by it and by him who dwells in it; and he who swears by heaven\, swears by the throne of God and by him who sits upon it.\n\n\"Woe to you\, scribes and Pharisees\, hypocrites! for you tithe mint and dill and cumin\, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law\, justice and mercy and faith; these you ought to have done without neglecting the others. You blind guides\, straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel! \"Woe to you\, scribes and Pharisees\, hypocrites! for you cleanse the outside of the cup and of the plate\, but inside they are full of extortion and rapacity. You blind Pharisee! first cleanse the inside of the cup and of the plate\, that the outside also may be clean. Woe to you\, scribes and Pharisees\, hypocrites! for you are like white-washed tombs\, which outwardly appear beautiful\, but within they are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. So you also outwardly appear to men\, but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. Woe to you\, scribes and Pharisees\, hypocrites! for you build  the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous\, saying\, 'If we had lived in the days of our fathers\, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.' Thus you witness against yourselves\, that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets. Fill up\, then\, the measure of your fathers. You serpents\, you brood of vipers\, how are you to escape being sentenced to Gehenna? Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and scribes\, some of whom you will kill and crucify\, and some you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from town to town\, that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth\, from the blood of innocent Abel to the blood of Zacharias the son of Barachiah\, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar. Truly\, I say to you\, all this will come upon this generation.\n\n\"O Jerusalem\, Jerusalem\, killing the prophets and stoning those who are sent to you! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings\, and you would not! Behold\, your house is forsaken and desolate. For I tell you\, you will not see me again\, until you say\, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'\"\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 24:36-51; 25:1-46; 26:1-2\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"Of that day and hour no one knows\, not even the angels of heaven\, but the Father only. As were the days of Noah\, so will be the coming of the Son of man. For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking\, marrying and giving in marriage\, until the day when Noah entered the ark\, and they did not know until the flood came and swept them all away\, so will be the coming of the Son of man. Then two men will be in the field; one is taken and one is left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one is taken and one is left. Watch therefore\, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. But know this\, that if the householder had known in what part of the night the thief was coming\, he would have watched and would not have let his house be broken into. Therefore you also must be ready; for the Son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect.\n\n\"Who then is the faithful and wise servant\, whom his master has set over his household\, to give them their food at the proper time? Blessed is that servant whom his master when he comes will find so doing. Truly\, I say to you\, he will set him over all his possessions. But if that wicked servant says to himself\, 'My master is delayed\,' and begins to beat his fellow servants\, and eats and drinks with the drunken\, the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know\, and will cut him in pieces\, and put him with the hypocrites; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.\n\n\"Then the kingdom of heaven shall be compared to ten maidens who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish\, and five were wise. For when the foolish took their lamps\, they took no oil with them; but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps. As the bridegroom was delayed\, they all slumbered and slept. But at midnight there was a cry\, 'Behold\, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.' Then all those maidens rose and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said to the wise\, 'Give us some of your oil\, for our lamps are going out.' But the wise replied\, 'Perhaps there will not be enough for us and for you; go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.' And while they went to buy\, the bridegroom came\, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast; and the door was shut. Afterward the other maidens came also\, saying\, 'Lord\, Lord\, open to us.' But he replied\, 'Truly\, I say to you\, I do not know you.' Watch therefore\, for you know neither the day nor the hour when the Son of man shall come.\n\n\"For it will be as when a man going on a journey called his servants and entrusted to them his property; to one he gave five talents\, to another two\, to another one\, to each according to his ability. Then he went away. He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them; and he made five talents more. So also\, he who had the two talents made two talents more. But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money. Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. And he who had received the five talents came forward\, bringing five talents more\, saying\, 'Master\, you delivered to me five talents; here I have made five talents more.' His master said to him\, 'Well done\, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a little\, I will set you over much; enter into the joy of your master.' And he also who had the two talents came forward\, saying\, 'Master\, you delivered to me two talents; here I have made two talents more.' His master said to him\, 'Well done\, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a little\, I will set you over much; enter into the joy of your master.' He also who had received the one talent came forward\, saying\, 'Master\, I knew you to be a hard man\, reaping where you did not sow\, and gathering where you did not winnow; so I was afraid\, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.' But his master answered him\, 'You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sowed\, and gather where I have not winnowed? Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers\, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. So take the talent from him\, and give it to him who has the ten talents. For to every one who has will more be given\, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not\, even what he has will be taken away. And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.'\n\n\"When the Son of man comes in his glory\, and all the angels with him\, then he will sit on his glorious throne. Before him will be gathered all the nations\, and he will separate them one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats\, and he will place the sheep at his right hand\, but the goats at the left. Then the King will say to those at his right hand\, 'Come\, O blessed of my Father\, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave me food\, I was thirsty and you gave me drink\, I was a stranger and you welcomed me\, I was naked and you clothed me\, I was sick and you visited me\, I was in prison and you came to me.' Then the righteous will answer him\, 'Lord\, when did we see you hungry and feed you\, or thirsty and give you drink? And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you\, or naked and clothe you? And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?' And the King will answer them\, 'Truly\, I say to you\, as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren\, you did it to me.' Then he will say to those at his left hand\, 'Depart from me\, you cursed\, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels; for I was hungry and you gave me no food\, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink\, I was a stranger and you did not welcome me\, naked and you did not clothe me\, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.' Then they also will answer\, 'Lord\, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison\, and did not minister to you?' Then he will answer them\, 'Truly\, I say to you\, as you did it not to one of the least of these\, you did it not to me.' And they will go away into eternal punishment\, but the righteous into eternal life.\"\n\nWhen Jesus had finished all these sayings\, he said to his disciples\, \"You know that after two days the Passover is coming\, and the Son of man will be delivered up to be crucified.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Holy Wednesday
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 04/16/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Holy Wednesday; Agape\, Chionia\, and Irene\, the Holy Martyrs; Righteous Amphilochios of Patmos; Leonidas and Charissa\, Nike\, Galene\, Kallida\, Nounenchia\, Vasilissa\, and Theodora the Martyrs\n\nStrict Fast\n\nGospel Reading: John 12:17-50\nAt that time\, the crowd that had been with Jesus when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead bore witness. The reason why the crowd went to meet him was that they heard he had done this sign.  The Pharisees then said to one another\, \"You see that you can do nothing; look\, the world has gone after him.\"\n\nNow among those who went up to worship at the feast were some Greeks.  So these came to Philip\, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee\, and said to him\, \"Sir\, we wish to see Jesus.\" Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew went with Philip and they told Jesus.  And Jesus answered them\, \"The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified.  Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies\, it remains alone; but if it dies\, it bears much fruit.  He who loves his life loses it\, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.  If any one serves me\, he must follow me; and where I am\, there shall my servant be also; if any one serves me\, the Father will honor him.\n\n\"Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? 'Father\, save me from this hour'? No\, for this purpose I have come to this hour.  Father\, glorify your name.\" Then a voice came from heaven\, \"I have glorified it\, and I will glorify it again.\" The crowd standing by heard it and said that it had thundered. Others said\, \"An angel has spoken to him.\" Jesus answered\, \"This voice has come for your sake\, not for mine.  Now is the judgment of this world\, now shall the ruler of this world be cast out; and I\, when I am lifted up from the earth\, will draw all men to myself.\"  He said this to show by what death he was to die.  The crowd answered him\, \"We have heard from the law that the Christ remains for ever. How can you say that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?\" Jesus said to them\, \"The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light\, lest the darkness overtake you; he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes. While you have the light\, believe in the light\, that you may become sons of light.\"\n\nWhen Jesus had said this\, he departed and hid himself from them. Though he had done so many signs before them\, yet they did not believe in him;  it was that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: \"Lord\, who has believed our report\, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?\" Therefore they could not believe. For Isaiah again said\,  \"He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart\, lest they should see with their eyes and perceive with their heart\, and turn for me to heal them.\"  Isaiah said this because he saw his glory and spoke of him.  Nevertheless many even of the authorities believed in him\, but for fear of the Pharisees they did not confess it\, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.\n\nAnd Jesus cried out and said\, \"He who believes in me\, believes not in me but in him who sent me. And he who sees me sees him who sent me.  I have come as light into the world\, that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness. If any one hears my sayings and does not keep them\, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world.  He who rejects me and does not receive my sayings has a judge; the word that I have spoken will be his judge on the last day.  For I have not spoken on my own authority; the Father who sent me has himself given me commandment what to say and what to speak. And I know that his commandment is eternal life. What I say\, therefore\, I say as the Father has bidden me.\"\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 26:6-16\nWhen Jesus was at Bethany at the house of Simon the leper\, a woman came up to him with an alabaster flask of very expensive ointment and she poured it on his head\, as he sat at table. But when the disciples saw it\, they were indignant\, saying\, \"Why this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for a large sum\, and given to the poor.\" But Jesus\, aware of this\, said to them\, \"Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful thing to me. For you always have the poor with you\, but you will not always have me. In pouring this ointment on my body she has done it to prepare me for burial. Truly\, I say to you wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world\, what she has done will be told in memory of her.\" Then one of the twelve\, who was called Judas Iscariot\, went to the chief priests and said\, \"What will you give me if I deliver him to you?\" And they paid him thirty pieces of silver. And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him.\n\n

SUMMARY:Holy Thursday
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 04/17/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Holy Thursday; Symeon the Holy Martyr\, Bishop of Persepolis\, and those with him; Makarios\, Bishop of Corinth; Agapetos of Rome; Hadrian the New-Martyr; Donnan\, Abbot of Eigg\, and the Monk-Martyrs with him\n\nFast Day (Wine and Oil Allowed)\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Luke 22:1-39\nAt that time\, the feast of Unleavened Bread drew near\, which is called the Passover. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to put Jesus to death. For they feared the people. Then Satan entered into Judas called Iscariot\, who was of the number of the twelve; he went away and conferred with the chief priests and officers how he might betray him to them. And they were glad\, and engaged to give him money. So he agreed\, and sought an opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of the multitude. Then came the day of Unleavened Bread\, on which the passover lamb had to be sacrificed. So he sent Peter and John\, saying\, \"Go and prepare the passover for us\, that we may eat it.\" They said to him\, \"Where will you have us prepare it?\" He said to them\, \"Behold\, when you have entered the city\, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him into the house which he enters\, and tell the householder\, 'The Teacher says to you\, Where is the guest room\, where I am to eat the passover with my disciples?' And he will show you a large upper room furnished; there make ready.\" And they went\, and found it as he had told them; and they prepared the passover. And when the hour came\, he sat at table\, and the apostles with him. And he said to them. \"I have earnestly desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer; for I tell you I shall never eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.\" And he took a cup\, and when he had given thanks he said\, \"Take this\, and divide it among yourselves; for I tell you that from now on I shall not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes. \" And he took bread\, and when he had given thanks he broke it and gave it to them\, saying\, \"This is my body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.\" And likewise the cup after supper\, saying\, \"This cup which is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood. But behold the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table. For the Son of man goes as it has been determined; but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!\" And they began to question one another\, which of them it was that would do this. A dispute also arose among them\, which of them was to be regarded as the greatest. And he said to them\, \"The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors. But not so with you; rather let the greatest among you become as the youngest\, and the leader as one who serves. For which is the greater\, one who sits at table\, or one who serves? Is it not the one who sits at table? But I am among you as one who serves. You are those who have continued with me in my trials; and I assign to you\, as my Father assigned to me\, a kingdom\, that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom\, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. Simon\, Simon\, behold\, Satan demanded to have you\, that he might sift you like wheat\, but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail; and when you have turned again\, strengthen your brethren.\" And he said to him\, \"Lord\, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.\" He said\, \"I tell you\, Peter\, the cock will not crow this day\, until you three times deny that you know me. \" And he said to them\, \"When I sent you out with no purse or bag or sandals\, did you lack anything?\" They said\, \"Nothing.\" He said to them\, \"But now\, let him who has a purse take it\, and likewise a bag. And let him who has no sword sell his mantle and buy one. For I tell you that this scripture must be fulfilled in me\, \"And he was reckoned with transgressors'; for what is written about me has its fulfillment.\" And they said\, \"Look\, Lord\, here are two swords. \" And he said to them\, \"It is enough.\" \n And he came out\, and went\, as was his custom\, to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples followed him.\n\nEpistle Reading: I Corinthians 11:23-32\nBRETHREN\, I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you\, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread\, and when he had given thanks\, he broke it\, and said\, \"This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.\" In the same way also the cup\, after supper\, saying\, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this\, as often as you drink it\, in remembrance of me.\" For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup\, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.\n\nWhoever\, therefore\, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a man examine himself\, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For any one who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself. That is why many of you are weak and ill\, and some have died. But if we judged ourselves truly\, we should not be judged. But when we are judged by the Lord\, we are chastened so that we may not be condemned along with the world.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 26:1-20; John 13:3-17; Matthew 26:21-39; Luke 22:43-44; Matthew 26:40-75; 27:1-2\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"You know that after two days the Passover is coming\, and the Son of man will be delivered up to be crucified.\"\n\nThen the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the palace of the high priest\, who was called Caiaphas\, and took counsel together in order to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him. But they said\, \"Not during the feast\, lest there be a tumult among the people.\"\n\nNow when Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper\, a woman came up to him with an alabaster flask of very expensive ointment\, and she poured it on his head\, as he sat at table. But when the disciples saw it\, they were indignant\, saying\, \"Why this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for a large sum\, and given to the poor.\"\n\nBut Jesus\, aware of this\, said to them\, \"Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful thing to me.\n\nFor you always have the poor with you\, but you will not always have me.\n\nIn pouring this ointment on my body she has done it to prepare me for burial. Truly\, I say to you\, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world\, what she has done will be told in memory of her.\"\n\nThen one of the twelve\, who was called Judas Iscariot\, went to the chief priests and said\, \"What will you give me if I deliver him to you?\" And they paid him thirty pieces of silver. And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him.\n\nNow on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus\, saying\, \"Where will you have us prepare for you to eat the Passover?\" He said\, \"Go into the city to a certain one\, and say to him\, 'The Teacher says\, My time is at hand; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.'\" And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them\, and they prepared the Passover. When it was evening\, he sat at table with the twelve disciples.\n\nJesus\, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands\, and that he had come from God and was going to God\, rose from supper\, laid aside his garments\, and girded himself with a towel. Then he poured water into a basin\, and began to wash the disciples' feet\, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded.\n\nHe came to Simon Peter; and Peter said to him\, \"Lord\, do you wash my feet?\" Jesus answered him\, \"What I am doing you do not know now\, but afterward you will understand.\" Peter said to him\, \"You shall never wash my feet.\" Jesus answered him\, \"If I do not wash you\, you have no part in me.\" Simon Peter said to him\, \"Lord\, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!\" Jesus said to him\, \"He who has bathed does not need to wash\, except for his feet\, but he is clean all over; and you are clean\, but not every one of you.\" For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said\, \"You are not all clean.\"\n\nWhen he had washed their feet\, and taken his garments\, and resumed his place\, he said to them\, \"Do you know what I have done to you? You call me Teacher and Lord; and you are right\, for so I am. If I then\, your Lord and Teacher\, have washed your feet\, you also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example\, that you also should do as I have done to you. Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him. If you know these things\, blessed are you if you do them.\n\nAnd as they were eating\, he said\, \"Truly\, I say to you\, one of you will betray me.\" And they were very sorrowful\, and began to say to him one after another\, \"Is it I\, Lord?\" He answered\, \"He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me\, will betray me. The Son of man goes as it is written of him\, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.\" Judas\, who betrayed him\, said\, \"Is it I\, Master?\" He said to him\, \"You have said so.\"\n\nNow as they were eating\, Jesus took bread\, and blessed\, and broke it\, and gave it to the disciples and said\, \"Take\, eat; this is my body.\" And he took a cup\, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them\, saying\, \"Drink of it\, all of you; for this is my blood of the new covenant\, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you I shall not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.\"\n\nAnd when they had sung a hymn\, they went out to the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus said to them\, \"You will all fall away because of me this night; for it is written\, 'I will strike the shepherd\, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' But after I am raised up\, I will go before you to Galilee.\" Peter declared to him\, \"Though they all fall away because of you\, I will never fall away.\" Jesus said to him\, \"Truly\, I say to you\, this very night\, before the cock crows\, you will deny me three times.\" Peter said to him\, \"Even if I must die with you\, I will not deny you.\" And so said all the disciples.\n\nThen Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane\, and he said to his disciples\, \"Sit here\, while I go yonder and pray.\" And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee\, he began to be sorrowful and troubled. Then he said to them\, \"My soul is very sorrowful\, even to death; remain here\, and watch with me.\" And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed\, \"My Father\, if it be possible\, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless\, not as I will\, but as you will.\"\n\nAnd there appeared to him an angel from heaven\, strengthening him. And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground.\n\nAnd rising from prayer\, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter\, \"So\, could you not watch with me one hour? Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing\, but the flesh is weak.\" Again\, for the second time\, he went away and prayed\, \"My Father\, if this cannot pass unless I drink it\, your will be done.\" And again he came and found them sleeping\, for their eyes were heavy. So\, leaving them again\, he went away and prayed for the third time\, saying the same words. Then he came to the disciples and said to them\, \"Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Behold\, the hour is at hand\, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise\, let us be going; see\, my betrayer is at hand.\"\n\nWhile he was still speaking\, Judas came\, one of the twelve\, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs\, from the chief priests and the elders of the people. Now the betrayer had given them a sign\, saying\, \"The one I shall kiss is the man; seize him.\" And he came up to Jesus at once and said\, \"Hail\, Rabbi!\" And he kissed him. Jesus said to him\, \"Friend\, why are you here?\" Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him. And behold\, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword\, and struck the slave of the high priest\, and cut off his ear.\n\nThen Jesus said to him\, \"Put your sword back into its place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword. Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father\, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then should the scriptures be fulfilled\, that it must be so?\"\n\nAt that hour Jesus said to the crowds\, \"Have you come out as against a robber\, with swords and clubs to capture me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching\, and you did not seize me. But all this has taken place\, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.\" Then all the disciples forsook him and fled.\n\nThen those who had seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest\, where the scribes and the elders had gathered. But Peter followed him at a distance\, as far as the courtyard of the high priest\, and going inside he sat with the guards to see the end. Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death\, but they found none\, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward and said\, \"This fellow said\, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God\, and to build it in three days.'\"\n\nAnd the high priest stood up and said\, \"Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?\" But Jesus was silent. And the high priest said to him\, \"I adjure you by the living God\, tell us if you are the Christ\, the Son of God.\"\n\nJesus said to him\, \"You have said so. But I tell you\, hereafter you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of Power\, and coming on the clouds of heaven.\" Then the high priest tore his robes\, and said\, \"He has uttered blasphemy. Why do we still need witnesses? You have now heard his blasphemy. What is your judgment?\" They answered\, \"He deserves death.\" Then they spat in his face\, and struck him; and some slapped him\, saying\, \"Prophesy to us\, you Christ! Who is it that struck you?\"\n\nNow Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a maid came up to him\, and said\, \"You also were with Jesus the Galilean.\" But he denied it before them all\, saying\, \"I do not know what you mean.\" And when he went out to the porch\, another maid saw him\, and she said to the bystanders\, \"This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.\" And again he denied it with an oath\, \"I do not know the man.\" After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter\, \"Certainly you are also one of them\, for your accent betrays you.\"\n\nThen he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear\, \"I do not know the man.\" And immediately the cock crowed. And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus\, \"Before the cock crows\, you will deny me three times.\" And he went out and wept bitterly.\n\nWhen morning came\, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death; and they bound him and led him away and delivered him to Pilate the governor.\n\nERROR: Twelve Gospels\n

Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump\, as you really are unleavened. For Christ\, our paschal lamb\, has been sacrificed. Let us\, therefore\, celebrate the festival\, not with the old leaven\, the leaven of malice and evil\, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. (Galatians 3.13-14) Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law\, having become a curse for us - for it is written\, \"Cursed be everyone who hangs on a tree\" - that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles\, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 27:62-66\nOn the next day\, that is\, after the day of Preparation\, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate and said\, \"Sir\, we remember how that impostor said\, while he was still alive\, 'After three days I will rise again.' Therefore order the sepulcher to be made secure until the third day\, lest his disciples go and steal him away\, and tell the people\, 'He has risen from the dead\,' and the last fraud will be worse than the first.\" Pilate said to them\, \"You have a guard of soldiers; go\, make it as secure as you can.\" So they went and made the sepulcher secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard.\n\n

SUMMARY:Holy Saturday
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 04/19/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Holy Saturday; The Holy Hieromartyr Paphnutius; Tryphon\, Patriarch of Constantinople; George the Confessor; Aelphege the Hieromartyr of Canterbury\n\nStrict Fast\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Matthew 27:62-66\nOn the next day\, that is\, after the day of Preparation\, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate and said\, \"Sir\, we remember how that impostor said\, while he was still alive\, 'After three days I will rise again.' Therefore order the sepulcher to be made secure until the third day\, lest his disciples go and steal him away\, and tell the people\, 'He has risen from the dead\,' and the last fraud will be worse than the first.\" Pilate said to them\, \"You have a guard of soldiers; go\, make it as secure as you can.\" So they went and made the sepulcher secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard.\n\nEpistle Reading: Romans 6:3-11\nBrethren\, all who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death.  We were buried therefore with Him by baptism into death\, so that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father\, we too might walk in newness of life.  For if we have been united with Him in a death like His\, we shall certainly be united with Him in a resurrection like His.  We know that our old self was crucified with Him so that the sinful body might be destroyed\, and we might no longer be enslaved to sin.  For he who has died is freed from sin.  But if we have died with Christ\, we believe that we shall also live with Him.  For we know that Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; death no longer has dominion over Him.  The death He died He died to sin\, once for all\, but the life He lives He lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 28:1-20\nAfter the sabbath\, toward the dawn of the first day of the week\, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the sepulcher. And behold\, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone\, and sat upon it. His appearance was like lightning\, and his raiment white as snow. And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men. But the angel said to the women\, \"Do not be afraid; for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. He is not here; for he has risen\, as he said. Come\, see the place where he lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead\, and behold\, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. Lo\, I have told you.\" So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy\, and ran to tell his disciples. And behold\, Jesus met them and said\, \"Hail!\" And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him. Then Jesus said to them\, \"Do not be afraid; go and tell my brethren to go to Galilee\, and there they will see me.\"\n\nWhile they were going\, behold\, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests all that had taken place. And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel\, they gave a sum of money to the soldiers and said\, \"Tell people\, 'His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.' And if this comes to the governor's ears\, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.\" So they took the money and did as they were directed; and this story has been spread among the Jews to this day.\n\nNow the eleven disciples went to Galilee\, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them. And when they saw him they worshiped him; but some doubted. And Jesus came and said to them\, \"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations\, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo\, I am with you always\, to the close of the age. Amen.\"\n\n

And very early on the first day of the week they went to the tomb when the sun had risen. And they were saying to one another\, \"Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the tomb?\" And looking up\, they saw that the stone was rolled back - it was very large. And entering the tomb\, they saw a young man sitting on the right side\, dressed in a white robe; and they were amazed. And he said to them\, \"Do not be amazed; you seek Jesus of Nazareth\, who was crucified. He has risen\, He is not here; see the place where they laid Him. But go\, tell His disciples and Peter that He is going before you to Galilee; there you will see Him\, as He told you.\" And they went out and fled from the tomb\, for trembling and astonishment had come upon them; and they said nothing to anyone\, for they were afraid.\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 1:1-8\nIn the first book\, O Theophilos\, I have dealt with all that Jesus began to do and teach\, until the day when he was taken up\, after he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen. To them he presented himself alive after his passion by many proofs\, appearing to them during forty days\, and speaking of the kingdom of God. And while staying with them he charged them not to depart from Jerusalem\, but to wait for the promise of the Father\, which\, he said\, \"you heard from me\, for John baptized with water\, but before many days you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.\"\n\nSo when they had come together\, they asked him\, \"Lord\, will you at this time restore the kingdom of lsrael?\" He said to them\, \"it is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has fixed by his own authority. But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the end of the earth.\"\n\nGospel Reading: John 1:1-17\nIn the beginning was the Word\, and the Word was with God\, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God; all things were made through him\, and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life\, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness\, and the darkness has not overcome it. \n\nThere was a man sent from God\, whose name was John. He came for testimony\, to bear witness to the light\, that all might believe through him. He was not the light\, but came to bear witness to the light.\n\nThe true light that enlightens every man was coming into the world. He was in the world\, and the world was made through him\, yet the world knew him not. He came to his own home\, and his own people received him not. But to all who received him\, who believed in his name\, he gave power to become children of God; who were born\, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man\, but of God.\n\nAnd the Word became flesh and dwelt among us\, full of grace and truth; we have beheld his glory\, glory as of the only Son from the Father. (John bore witness to him\, and cried\, \"This was he of whom I said\, 'He who comes after me ranks before me\, for he was before me.'\") And from his fullness have we all received\, grace upon grace. For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.\n\n

All these with one accord devoted themselves to prayer\, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus\, and with his brothers.\n\nIn those days Peter stood up among the brethren (the company of persons was in all about a hundred and twenty)\, and said\, \"Brethren\, the scripture had to be fulfilled\, which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David\, concerning Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus. For he was numbered among us\, and was allotted his share in this ministry. \"So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us\, beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us -- one of these men must become with us a witness to his resurrection.\"\n\nAnd they put forward two\, Joseph called Barsabbas\, who was surnamed Justos\, and Matthias. And they prayed and said\, \"Lord\, who knowest the hearts of all men\, show which one of these two thou hast chosen to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside\, to go to his own place.\" And they cast lots for them\, and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was enrolled with the eleven apostles.\n\nGospel Reading: John 1:18-28\nNo one has ever seen God; the only-begotten Son\, who is in the bosom of the Father\, he has made him known.\n\nAnd this is the testimony of John\, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him\, \"Who are you?\" He confessed\, he did not deny\, but confessed\, \"I am not the Christ.\" And they asked him\, \"What then? Are you Elijah?\" He said\, \"I am not.\" \"Are you the prophet?\" And he answered\, \"No.\" They said to him then\, \"Who are you? let us have an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\" He said\, \"I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness\, 'Make straight the way of the Lord\,' as the prophet Isaiah said.\"\n\nNow they had been sent from the Pharisees. They asked him\, \"Then why are you baptizing\, if you are neither the Christ\, nor Elijah\, nor the prophet?\" John answered them\, \"I baptize with water; but among you stands one whom you do not know\, even he who comes after me\, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.\" This took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan\, where John was baptizing.\n\n

For these men are not drunk\, as you suppose\, since it is only the third hour of the day; but this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel: 'And in the last days it shall be\, God declares\, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh\, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy\, and your young men shall see visions\, and your old men shall dream dreams; yea\, and on my menservants and my maid servants in those days I will pour out my Spirit; and they shall prophesy. And I will show wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth beneath\, blood\, and fire\, and vapor of smoke; the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood\, before the day of the Lord comes\, the great and manifest day. And it shall be that whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.'\"\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 24:12-35\nAt that time\, [Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in\, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home wondering at what had happened. That very day] two of them were going to a village named Emmaus\, about seven miles from Jerusalem\, and talking with each other about all these things that had happened. While they were talking and discussing together\, Jesus Himself drew near and went with them. But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him. And He said to them\, \"What is this conversation which you are holding with each other as you walk?\" and they stood still\, looking sad. Then one of them\, named Cleopas\, answered Him\, \"Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?\" And He said to them\, \"What things?\" And they said to him\, \"Concerning Jesus of Nazareth\, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people\, and how our chief priests and rulers delivered Him up to be condemned to death\, and crucified Him. But we had hoped that He was the one to redeem Israel. Yes\, and besides all this\, it is now the third day since this happened. Moreover\, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning and did not find His body; and they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels\, who said that He was alive. Some of those who were with us went to the tomb\, and found it just as the women had said; but Him they did not see.\" And He said to them\, \"O foolish men\, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Was not it necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into this glory?\" And beginning with Moses and all the prophets\, He interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning Himself. So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He appeared to be going further\, but they constrained Him\, saying\, \"Stay with us\, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.\" So He went in to stay with them. When He was at table with them\, He took the bread and blessed\, and broke it\, and gave it to them. And their eyes were opened and they recognized Him; and He vanished out of their sight. They said to each other\, \"Did not our hearts burn within us while He talked to us on the road\, while He opened to us the scriptures?\" And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven gathered together and those who were with them\, who said\, \"The Lord has risen indeed\, and has appeared to Simon!\" Then they told what had happened on the road and how He was known to them in the breaking of the bread.\n\n

This will be a time for you to bear testimony. Settle it therefore in your minds\, not to meditate beforehand how to answer; for I will give you a mouth and wisdom\, which none of your adversaries will be able to withstand or contradict. You will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and kinsmen and friends\, and some of you they will put to death; you will be hated by all for my name's sake. But not a hair of your head will perish. By your endurance you will gain your lives.\"\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 12:1-11\nAbout that time\, Herod the king laid violent hands upon some who belonged to the church. He killed James the brother of John with the sword; and when he saw that it pleased the Jews\, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the days of Unleavened Bread. And when he had seized him\, he put him in prison\, and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to guard him\, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people. So Peter was kept in prison; but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the Church.\n\nThe very night when Herod was about to bring him out\, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers\, bound with two chains\, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison; and behold\, an angel of the Lord appeared\, and a light shone in the cell; and he struck Peter on the side and woke him\, saying\, \"Get up quickly.\" And the chains fell off his hands. And the angel said to him\, \"Wrap your mantle around you and follow me.\" And he went out and followed him; he did not know that what was done by the angel was real\, but thought he was seeing a vision. When they had passed the first and the second guard\, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. It opened to them of its own accord\, and they went out and passed on through one street; and immediately the angel left him. And Peter came to himself\, and said\, \"Now I am sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.\"\n\nGospel Reading: John 1:35-51\nAt that time\, John was standing with two of his disciples; and he looked at Jesus as he walked\, and said\, \"Behold\, the Lamb of God!\" The two disciples heard him say this\, and they followed Jesus. Jesus turned\, and saw them following\, and said to them\, \"What do you seek?\" And they said to him\, \"Rabbi\"  (which means Teacher)\, \"where are you staying?\"  He said to them\, \"Come and see.\"  They came and saw where he was staying; and they stayed with him that day\, for it was about the tenth hour. One of the two who heard John speak\, and followed him\, was Andrew\, Simon Peter's brother. He first found his brother Simon\, and said to him\, \"We have found the Messiah\" (which means Christ). He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said\, \"So you are Simon the son of Jonah [John]? You shall be called Cephas\" (which means Peter).\n\nThe next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. And he found Philip and said to him\, \"Follow me.\"  Now Philip was from Bethsaida\, the city of Andrew and Peter. Philip found Nathanael\, and said to him\, \"We have found him of whom Moses in the law and also the prophets wrote\, Jesus of Nazareth\, the son of Joseph.\"  Nathanael said to him\, \"Can anything good come out of Nazareth?\" Philip said to him\, \"Come and see.\" Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him\, and said of him\, \"Behold\, an Israelite indeed\, in whom is no guile!\"  Nathanael said to him\, \"How do you know me?\"  Jesus answered him\, \"Before Philip called you\, when you were under the fig tree\, I saw you.\"  Nathanael answered him\, \"Rabbi\, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!\"  Jesus answered him\, \"Because I said to you\, I saw you under the fig tree\, do you believe? You shall see greater things than these.\" And he said to him\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, you will see heaven opened\, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.\"\n\n

For the promise is to you and to your children and to all that are far off\, every one whom the Lord our God calls to him.\" And he testified with many other words and exhorted them\, saying\, \"Save yourselves from this crooked generation.\" So those who received his word were baptized\, and there were added that day about three thousand souls. And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship\, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. And fear came upon every soul; and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.\n\nGospel Reading: John 3:1-15\nAt that time\, there was a man of the Pharisees\, named Nikodemos\, a ruler of the Jews. This man came to Jesus by night and said to him\, \"Rabbi\, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that you do\, unless God is with him.\" Jesus answered him\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, unless one is born from above\, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\" Nikodemos said to him\, \"How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?\" Jesus answered\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, unless one is born of water and the Spirit\, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh\, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you\, 'You must be born from above.' The Spirit blows where it wills\, and you hear the sound of it\, and you do not know whence it comes or whither it goes; so it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.\" Nikodemos said to him\, \"How can this be?\" Jesus answered him\, \"Are you a teacher of Israel\, and yet you do not understand this? Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, we speak of what we know\, and bear witness to what we have seen; but you do not receive our testimony. If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe\, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things? No one has ascended into heaven but he who descended from heaven\, the Son of man who is in heaven. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness\, so must the Son of man be lifted up\, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.\"\n\n

And a man lame from birth was being carried\, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask alms of those who entered the temple. Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple\, he asked for alms. And Peter directed his gaze at him\, with John\, and said\, \"Look at us.\" And he fixed his attention upon them\, expecting to receive something from them. But Peter said\, \"I have no silver and gold\, but I give you what I have; in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth\, walk.\" And he took him by the right hand and raised him up; and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong. And leaping up he stood and walked and entered the temple with them\, walking and leaping and praising God.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 10:16-21\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"He who hears you hears me\, and he who rejects you rejects me\, and he who rejects me rejects him who sent me.\" The seventy returned with joy\, saying\, \"Lord\, even the demons are subject to us in your name!\" And he said to them\, \"I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. Behold\, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions\, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall hurt you. Nevertheless do not rejoice in this\, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.\" In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said\, \"I thank you\, Father\, Lord of heaven and earth\, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes; yes\, Father\, for such was your gracious will.\"\n\n

And when Peter saw it he addressed the people\, \"Men of Israel\, why do you wonder at this\, or why do you stare at us\, as though by our own power or piety we had made him walk? The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob\, the God of our fathers\, glorified his servant Jesus\, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate\, when he had decided to release him. But you denied the Holy and Righteous One\, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you\, and killed the Author of life\, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses. And his name\, by faith in his name\, has made this man strong whom you see and know; and the faith which is through him has given the man this perfect health in the presence of you all.\"\n\nGospel Reading: John 3:22-33\nAt that time\, Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judea; there He remained with them and baptized.  John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim\, because there was much water there; and people came and were baptized.  For John had not yet been put in prison.\n\nNow a discussion arose between John's disciples and a Jew over purifying.  And they came to John\, and said to him\, \"Rabbi\, he who was with you beyond the Jordan\, to whom you bore witness\, here he is\, baptizing\, and all are going to him.\"  John answered\, \"No one can receive anything except what is given him from heaven.  You yourselves bear me witness\, that I said\, I am not the Christ\, but I have been sent before Him.  He who has the bride is the bridegroom; the friend of the bridegroom\, who stands and hears him\, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice; therefore this joy of mine is now full.  He must increase\, but I must decrease.\n\n\"He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth belongs to the earth\, and of the earth he speaks; he who comes from heaven is above all.  He bears witness to what he has seen and heard\, yet no one receives his testimony; he who receives his testimony sets his seal to this\, that God is true.\"\n\n

And when they saw Him they worshiped Him; but some doubted. And Jesus came and said to them\, \"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations\, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit\, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo\, I am with you always\, to the close of the age. Amen.\"\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 5:12-20\nIn those days\, many signs and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the apostles. And they were all together in Solomon's Portico. None of the rest dared join them\, but the people held them in high honor. And more than ever believers were added to the Lord\, multitudes both of men and women\, so that they even carried out the sick into the streets\, and laid them on beds and pallets\, that as Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some of them. The people also gathered from the towns around Jerusalem\, bringing the sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits\, and they were all healed. But the high priest rose up and all who were with him\, that is\, the party of the Sadducees\, and filled with jealousy they arrested the apostles and put them in the common prison. But at night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out and said\, \"Go and stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this Life.\"\n\nGospel Reading: John 20:19-31\nOn the evening of that day\, the first day of the week\, the doors being shut where the disciples were for fear of the Jews\, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them\, \"Peace be with you.\" When He had said this\, He showed them His hands and His side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again\, \"Peace be with you. As the Father has sent Me\, even so I send you.\" And when He had said this\, He breathed on them and said to them\, \"Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any\, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any\, they are retained.\" Now Thomas\, one of the twelve\, called the Twin\, was not with them when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him\, \"We have seen the Lord.\" But he said to them\, \"Unless I see in His hands the print of the nails\, and place my finger in the mark of the nails\, and place my hand in His side\, I will not believe.\" Eight days later\, His disciples were again in the house\, and Thomas was with them. The doors were shut\, but Jesus came and stood among them and said\, \"Peace be with you.\" Then He said to Thomas\, \"Put your finger here\, and see My hands; and put out your hand\, and place it in My side; do not be faithless\, but believing.\" Thomas answered Him\, \"My Lord and My God!\" Jesus said to him\, \"Have you believed because you have seen Me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe.\" Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples\, which are not written in this book; but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ\, the Son of God\, and that believing\, you may have life in His name.\n\n

Moses said\, 'The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet from your brethren as he raised me up. You shall listen to him in whatever he tells you. And it shall be that every soul that does not listen to that prophet shall be destroyed from the people.' And all the prophets who have spoken\, from Samuel and those who came afterwards\, also proclaimed these days. You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God gave to your fathers\, saying to Abraham\, 'And in your posterity shall all the families of the earth be blessed.' God\, having raised up his servant\, sent him to you first\, to bless you in turning every one of you from your wickedness.\"\n\nGospel Reading: John 2:1-11\nAt that time\, there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee\, and the mother of Jesus was there; Jesus also was invited to the wedding\, with his disciples. When the wine gave out\, the mother of Jesus said to him\, \"They have no wine.\" And Jesus said to her\, \"O woman\, what have you to do with me? My hour has not yet come.\" His mother said to the servants\, \"Do whatever he tells you.\" Now six stone jars were standing there\, for the Jewish rites of purification\, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. Jesus said to them\, \"Fill the jars with water.\" And they filled them up to the brim. He said to them\, \"Now draw some out\, and take it to the steward of the feast.\" So they took it. When the steward of the feast tasted the water now become wine\, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew)\, the steward of the feast called the bridegroom and said to him\, \"Every man serves the good wine first; and when men have drunk freely\, then the poor wine; but you have kept the good wine until now.\" This\, the first of his signs\, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee\, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed in him.\n\n

And when they had set them in the midst\, they inquired\, \"By what power or by what name did you do this?\" Then Peter\, filled with the Holy Spirit\, said to them\, \"Rulers of the people and elders\, if we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to a cripple\, by what means this man has been healed\, be it known to you all\, and to all the people of Israel\, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth\, whom you crucified\, whom God raised from the dead\, by him this man is standing before you well.\"\n\nGospel Reading: John 3:16-21\nThe Lord said to his disciples: \"God so loved the world that he gave his only Son\, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God sent the Son into the world\, not to condemn the world\, but that the world might be saved through him. He who believes in him is not condemned; he who does not believe is condemned already\, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment\, that the light has come into the world\, and men loved darkness rather than light\, because their deeds were evil. For every one who does evil hates the light\, and does not come to the light\, lest his deeds should be exposed. But he who does what is true comes to the light\, that it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been wrought in God.\"\n\n

He killed James the brother of John with the sword; and when he saw that it pleased the Jews\, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the days of Unleavened Bread. And when he had seized him\, he put him in prison\, and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to guard him\, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people. So Peter was kept in prison; but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the Church.\n\nThe very night when Herod was about to bring him out\, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers\, bound with two chains\, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison; and behold\, an angel of the Lord appeared\, and a light shone in the cell; and he struck Peter on the side and woke him\, saying\, \"Get up quickly.\" And the chains fell off his hands. And the angel said to him\, \"Wrap your mantle around you and follow me.\" And he went out and followed him; he did not know that what was done by the angel was real\, but thought he was seeing a vision. When they had passed the first and the second guard\, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. It opened to them of its own accord\, and they went out and passed on through one street; and immediately the angel left him. And Peter came to himself\, and said\, \"Now I am sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.\"\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 9:1-6\nAt that time\, Jesus called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases\, and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal. And he said to them\, \"Take nothing for your journey\, no staff\, nor bag\, nor bread\, nor money; and do not have two tunics. And whatever house you enter\, stay there\, and from there depart. And wherever they do not receive you\, when you leave that town shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them.\" And they departed and went through the villages\, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.\n\n

And when they heard it\, they lifted their voices together to God and said\, \"Sovereign Lord\, who didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them\, who by the mouth of our father David\, thy servant\, didst say by the Holy Spirit\, 'Why did the Gentiles rage\, and the peoples imagine vain things? The kings of the earth set themselves in array\, and the rulers were gathered together\, against the Lord and against his Anointed'- for truly in this city there were gathered together against thy holy servant Jesus\, whom thou didst anoint\, both Herod and Pontius Pilate\, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel\, to do whatever thy hand and thy plan had predestined to take place. And now\, Lord\, look upon their threats\, and grant to thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness\, while thou stretchest out thy hand to heal\, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of thy holy servant Jesus.\" And when they had prayed\, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness.\n\nGospel Reading: John 5:24-30\nThe Lord said to the Jews who came to him\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, he who hears my word and believes him who sent me\, has eternal life; he does not come into judgment\, but has passed from death to life. Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, the hour is coming\, and now is\, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God\, and those who hear will live. For as the Father has life in himself\, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself\, and has given him authority to execute judgment\, because he is the Son of man. Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice and come forth\, those who have done good\, to the resurrection of life\, and those who have done evil\, to the resurrection of judgment. I can do nothing on my own authority; as I hear\, I judge; and my judgment is just\, because I seek not my own will but the will of the Father who sent me.\"\n\n

Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and for ever.  Do not be led away by diverse and strange teachings; for it is well that the heart be strengthened by grace\, not by foods\, which have not benefited their adherents.  We have an altar from which those who serve the tent have no right to eat.  For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned outside the camp.  So Jesus also suffered outside the gate in order to sanctify the people through his own blood.  Therefore let us go forth to him outside the camp and bear the abuse he endured.  For here we have no lasting city\, but we seek the city which is to come.  Through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God\, that is\, the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name.  Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have\, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God. \n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 5:14-19\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"You are the light of the world.  A city set on a hill cannot be hid.  Nor do men light a lamp and put it under a bushel\, but on a stand\, and it gives light to all in the house.  Let your light so shine before men\, that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.  Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfill them.  For truly\, I say to you\, till heaven and earth pass away\, not an iota\, not a dot\, will pass from the law until all is accomplished.  Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so\, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\"\n\n

Now the high priest came and those who were with him and called together the council and all the senate of Israel\, and sent to the prison to have them brought. But when the officers came\, they did not find them in the prison\, and they returned and reported\, 'We found the prison securely locked and the sentries standing at the doors\, but when we opened it we found no one inside.\" Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words\, they were much perplexed about them\, wondering what this would come to. And some one came and told them\, \"The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.\" Then the captain with the officers went and brought them\, but without violence\, for they were afraid of being stoned by the people.\n\nAnd when they had brought them\, they set them before the council. And the high priest questioned them\, saying\, \"We strictly charged you not to teach in this name\, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and you intend to bring this man's blood upon us.\" But Peter and the apostles answered\, \"We must obey God rather than men. The God of our fathers raised Jesus whom you killed by hanging on a tree. God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior\, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. And we are witnesses to these things\, and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him.\"\n\nGospel Reading: John 6:14-27\nAt that time\, when the people saw the sign which Jesus had done\, they said\, \"This is indeed the prophet who is to come into the world!\"\n\nPerceiving then that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king\, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by himself.\n\nWhen evening came\, his disciples went down to the sea\, entered a boat\, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark\, and Jesus had not yet come to them. The sea rose because a strong wind was blowing. When they had rowed about three or four miles\, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near to the boat. They were frightened\, but he said to them\, \"It is I; do not be afraid.\" Then they were glad to take him into the boat\, and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.\n\nOn the next day the people who remained on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there\, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples\, but that his disciples had gone away alone. However\, boats from Tiberias came near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks. So when the people saw that Jesus was not there\, nor his disciples\, they themselves entered the boats and went to Capernaum\, seeking Jesus.\n\nWhen they found him on the other side of the sea\, they said to him\, \"Rabbi\, when did you come here?\" Jesus answered them\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, you seek me\, not because you saw signs\, but because you ate your fill of the loaves. Do not labor for the food which perishes\, but for the food which endures to eternal life which the Son of man will give to you; for on him has God the Father set his seal.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Sunday of the Myrrh-Bearing Women
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 05/04/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Sunday of the Myrrh-Bearing Women; Pelagia the Nun-martyr of Tarsus; Hilary the Wonderworker; Euthemios\, Bishop of Madytos; Athanasios\, Bishop of Corinth\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Luke 24:1-12\nOn the first day of the week at early dawn\, the women went to the tomb\, taking spices\, which they had prepared. And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb\, but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. While they were perplexed about this\, behold\, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel; and as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground\, the men said to them\, \"Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here\, but has risen. Remember how He told you\, while He was still in Galilee\, that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men\, and be crucified\, and on the third day rise.\" And they remembered His words and returning from the tomb they told all this to the eleven and to all the rest. Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told this to the Apostles; but these words seemed to them an idle tale\, and they did not believe them. But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in\, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home wondering at what had happened.\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 6:1-7\nIn those days\, when the disciples were increasing in number\, the Hellenists murmured against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily distribution. And the twelve summoned the body of the disciples and said\, \"it is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables. Therefore\, brethren\, pick out from among you seven men of good repute\, full of the Spirit and of wisdom\, whom we may appoint to this duty. But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.\" And what they said pleased the whole multitude\, and they chose Stephen\, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit\, and Philip\, and Prochoros\, and Nicanor\, and Timon\, and Parmenas\, and Nicolaos\, a proselyte of Antioch. These they set before the apostles\, and they prayed and laid their hands upon them. And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem\, and a great many of the priests were obedient to the faith.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 15:43-47; 16:1-8\nAt that time\, Joseph of Arimathea\, a respected member of the council\, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God\, took courage and went to Pilate\, and asked for the body of Jesus. And Pilate wondered if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion\, he asked him whether he was already dead. And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead\, he granted the body to Joseph. And he bought a linen shroud\, and taking him down\, wrapped him in the linen shroud\, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.\n\nAnd when the sabbath was past\, Mary Magdalene\, and Mary the mother of James\, and Salome\, bought spices\, so that they might go and anoint him. And very early on the first day of the week they went to the tomb when the sun had risen. And they were saying to one another\, \"Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the tomb?\" And looking up\, they saw that the stone was rolled back; for it was very large. And entering the tomb\, they saw a young man sitting on the right side\, dressed in a white robe; and they were amazed. And he said to them\, \"Do not be amazed; you seek Jesus of Nazareth\, who was crucified. He has risen\, he is not here; see the place where they laid him. But go\, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him\, as he told you.\" And they went out and fled from the tomb; for trembling and astonishment had come upon them; and they said nothing to anyone\, for they were afraid.\n\n

Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called)\, and of the Cyrenians\, and of the Alexandrians\, and of those from Cilicia and Asia\, arose and disputed with Stephen. But they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke. Then they secretly instigated men\, who said\, \"We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.\" And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes\, and they came upon him and seized him and brought him before the council\, and set up false witnesses who said\, \"This man never ceases to speak words against this holy place and the law; for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place\, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.\" And gazing at him\, all who sat in the council saw that his face was like the face of an angel.\n\nAnd the high priest said\, \"Is this so?\" And Stephen said: \"Brethren and fathers\, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham\, when he was in Mesopotamia\, before he lived in Haran\, and said to him\, 'Depart from your land and from your kindred and go into the land which I will show you.' Then he departed from the land of the Chaldeans\, and lived in Haran. And after his father died\, God removed him from there into this land in which you are now living; yet he gave him no inheritance in it\, not even a foot's length\, but promised to give it to him in possession and to his posterity after him\, though he had no child.\n\n\"But it was Solomon who built a house for him. Yet the Most High does not dwell in houses made with hands; as the prophet says\, 'Heaven is my throne\, and earth my footstool. What house will you build for me\, says the Lord\, or what is the place of my rest? Did not my hand make all these things?'\n\n\"You stiff-necked people\, uncircumcised in heart and ears\, you always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did\, so do you. Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One\, whom you have now betrayed and murdered\, you who received the law as delivered by angels and did not keep it.\"\n\nNow when they heard these things they were enraged\, and they ground their teeth against him. But he\, full of the Holy Spirit\, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God\, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God; and he said\, \"Behold\, I see the heavens opened\, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God.\" But they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and rushed together upon him. Then they cast him out of the city and stoned him; and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul. And as they were stoning Stephen\, he prayed\, \"Lord Jesus\, receive my spirit.\" And he knelt down and cried with a loud voice\, \"Lord\, do not hold this sin against them.\" And when he had said this\, he fell asleep.\n\nGospel Reading: John 4:46-54\nAt that time\, there was an official whose son was ill. When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee\, he went and begged him to come down and heal his son\, for he was at the point of death. Jesus therefore said to him\, \"Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe.\" The official said to him\, \"Sir\, come down before my child dies.\" Jesus said to him\, \"Go; your son will live.\" The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went his way. As he was going down\, his servants met him and told him that his son was living. So he asked them the hour when he began to mend\, and they said to him\, \"Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.\" The father knew that was the hour when Jesus had said to him\, \"Your son will live\"; and he himself believed\, and all his household. This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from Judea to Galilee.\n\n

Domvu; Sophia of Kleisoura\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 8:5-17\nIn those days\, Philip went down to a city of Samaria\, and proclaimed to them the Christ. And the multitudes with one accord gave heed to what was said by Philip\, when they heard him and saw the signs which he did. For unclean spirits came out of many who were possessed\, crying with a loud voice; and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed. So there was much joy in the city.\n\nBut there was a man named Simon who had previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the nation of Samaria\, saying that he himself was somebody great. They all gave heed to him\, from the least to the greatest\, saying\, \"This man is that power of God which is called Great.\" And they gave heed to him\, because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic. But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ\, they were baptized\, both men and women. Even Simon himself believed\, and after being baptized he continued with Philip. And seeing signs and great miracles performed\, he was amazed.\n\nNow when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God\, they sent to them Peter and John\, who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit; for it had not yet fallen on any of them\, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit.\n\nGospel Reading: John 6:27-33\nThe Lord said to the Jews who came to him: \"Do not labor for the food which perishes\, but for the food which endures to eternal life\, which the Son of man will give to you; for on him has God the Father set his seal.\" Then they said to him\, \"What must we do\, to be doing the works of God?\" Jesus answered them\, \"This is the work of God\, that you believe in him whom he has sent.\" So they said to him\, \"Then what sign do you do\, that we may see\, and believe you? What work do you perform? Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written\, 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'\" Jesus then said to them\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven; my Father gives you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.\"\n\n

At midday\, O king\, I saw on the way a light from heaven\, brighter than the sun\, shining round me and those who journeyed with me. And when we had all fallen to the ground\, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language\, 'Saul\, Saul\, why do you persecute me? It hurts you to kick against the goads.' And I said\, 'Who are you\, Lord?' And the Lord said\, 'I am Jesus whom you are persecuting. But rise and stand upon your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose\, to appoint you to serve and bear witness to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which I will appear to you\, delivering you from the people and from the Gentiles-to whom I send you to open their eyes\, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God\, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.' \"Wherefore\, O King Agrippa\, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision\, but declared first to those at Damascus\, then at Jerusalem and throughout all the country of Judea\, and also to the Gentiles\, that they should repent and turn to God and perform deeds worthy of their repentance.\" \n\nGospel Reading: John 6:35-39\nThe Lord said to the Jews who believed in him: \"I am the bread of life; he who comes to me shall not hunger\, and he who believes in me shall never thirst. But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe. All that the Father gives me will come to me; and him who comes to me I will not cast out.

Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, when you were young\, you girded yourself and walked where you would; but when you are old\, you will stretch out your hands\, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go.\" (This he said to show by what death he was to glorify God.) And after this he said to him\, \"Follow me.\" Peter turned and saw following them the disciple whom Jesus loved\, who had lain close to his breast at the supper and had said\, \"Lord\, who is it that is going to betray you?\" When Peter saw him\, he said to Jesus\, \"Lord\, what about this man?\" Jesus said to him\, \"If it is my will that he remain until I come\, what is that to you? Follow me!\" The saying spread abroad among the brethren that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die\, but\, \"If it is my will that he remain until I come\, what is that to you?\" This is the disciple who is bearing witness to these things\, and who has written these things; and we know that his testimony is true. But there are also many other things which Jesus did; were every one of them to be written\, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.\n\nEpistle Reading: I John 1:1-7\nTHAT WHICH WAS from the beginning\, which we have heard\, which we have seen with our eyes\, which we have looked upon and touched with our hands\, concerning the word of life - the life was made manifest\, and we saw it\, and testify to it\, and proclaim to you the eternal life which was with the Father and was made manifest to us - that which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you\, so that you may have fellowship with us; and our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. And we are writing this that our joy may be complete.\n\nThis is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you\, that God is light and in him is no darkness at all. If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness\, we lie and do not live according to the truth; but if we walk in the light\, as he is in the light\, we have fellowship with one another\, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.\n\nGospel Reading: John 19:25-28\, 21:24-25\nAt that time\, standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother\, and his mother's sister\, Mary the wife of Clopas\, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother\, and the disciple whom he loved standing near\, he said to his mother\, \"Woman\, behold\, your son!\" Then he said to the disciple\, \"Behold\, your mother!\" And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home. This is the disciple who is bearing witness to these things\, and who has written these things; and we know that his testimony is true. But there are also many other things which Jesus did; were every one of them to be written\, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.\n\n

SUMMARY:3rd Friday after Pascha
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 05/09/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: 3rd Friday after Pascha; The Holy Prophet Esaias (Isaiah); Christopher the Martyr of Lycea; Elder Hieronymos of Simonopetra; Monk-martyr Nicholas who lived in Vuneni\, of Larissa in Thessaly; Epimachos the New Martyr of Alexandria; The New Martyrs of Novo Selo\, Bulgaria\n\nFast Day (Wine and Oil Allowed)\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 8:40; 9:1-19\nIn those days\, Philip was found at Azotos\, and passing on he preached the gospel to all the towns till he came to Caesarea. But Saul\, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord\, went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus\, so that if he found any belonging to the Way\, men or women\, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. Now as he journeyed he approached Damascus\, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed about him. And he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him\, \"Saul\, Saul\, why do you persecute me?\" And he said\, \"Who are you\, Lord?\" And he said\, \" I am Jesus\, whom you are persecuting; but rise and enter the city\, and you will be told what you are to do.\" The men who were traveling with him stood speechless\, hearing the voice but seeing no one. Saul arose from the ground; and when his eyes were opened\, he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. And for three days he was without sight\, and neither ate nor drank.\n\nNow there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision\, \"Ananias.\" And he said\, \"Here I am\, Lord.\" And the Lord said to him\, \"Rise and go to the street called Straight\, and inquire in the house of Judas for a man of Tarsus named Saul; for behold\, he is praying\, and he has seen a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.\" But Ananias answered\, \"Lord\, I have heard from many about this man\, how much evil he has done to thy saints at Jerusalem; and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call upon thy name.\" But the Lord said to him\, \"Go\, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel; for I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.\" So Ananias departed and entered the house. And laying his hands on him he said\, \"Brother Saul\, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came\, has sent me that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.\" And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes and he regained his sight. Then he rose and was baptized\, and took food and was strengthened.\n\nGospel Reading: John 6:48-54\nThe Lord said to the Jews who believed in him: \"I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness\, and they died. This is the bread which comes down from heaven\, that a man may eat of it and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any one eats of this bread\, he will live forever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh.\"\n\nThe Jews then disputed among themselves\, saying\, \"How can this man give us his flesh to eat?\" So Jesus said to them\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood\, you have no life in you; he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life\, and I will raise him up at the last day.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Simon the Zealot & Apostle
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 05/10/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Simon the Zealot & Apostle; Laurence of Egypt; Isodora of Egypt\n\nEpistle Reading: I Corinthians 4:9-16\nBrethren\, God has exhibited us apostles as last of all\, like men sentenced to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world\, to angels and to men. We are fools for Christ's sake\, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak\, but you are strong. You are held in honor\, but we in disrepute. To the present hour we hunger and thirst\, we are ill-clad and buffeted and homeless\, and we labor\, working with our own hands. When reviled\, we bless; when persecuted\, we endure; when slandered\, we try to conciliate; we have become\, and are now\, as the refuse of the world\, the off-scouring of all things. I do not write this to make you ashamed\, but to admonish you as my beloved children. For though you have countless guides in Christ\, you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel. I urge you\, then\, be imitators of me.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 6:12-19\nAt that time\, Jesus went out to the mountain to pray; and all night he continued in prayer to God. And when it was day\, he called his disciples\, and chose from them twelve\, whom he named apostles; Simon\, whom he named Peter\, and Andrew his brother\, and James and John\, and Philip\, and Bartholomew\, and Matthew\, and Thomas\, and James the son of Alphaios\, and Simon who was called the Zealot\, and Judas the son of James\, and Judas Iscariot\, who became a traitor. And he came down with them and stood on a level place\, with a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon\, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured. And all the crowd sought to touch him\, for power came forth from him and healed them all.\n\n

SUMMARY:Sunday of the Paralytic
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 05/11/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Sunday of the Paralytic; Renewal of Constantinople; Hieromartyr Mocius; Methodius & Cyril\, Equal-to-the Apostles Illuminators of the Slavs; Theopemptos the Martyr & his Companions; Dioscoros the New Martyr; Argyrios the New-Martyr of Epanomi\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Luke 24:12-35\nAt that time\, [Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in\, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home wondering at what had happened. That very day] two of them were going to a village named Emmaus\, about seven miles from Jerusalem\, and talking with each other about all these things that had happened. While they were talking and discussing together\, Jesus Himself drew near and went with them. But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him. And He said to them\, \"What is this conversation which you are holding with each other as you walk?\" and they stood still\, looking sad. Then one of them\, named Cleopas\, answered Him\, \"Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?\" And He said to them\, \"What things?\" And they said to him\, \"Concerning Jesus of Nazareth\, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people\, and how our chief priests and rulers delivered Him up to be condemned to death\, and crucified Him. But we had hoped that He was the one to redeem Israel. Yes\, and besides all this\, it is now the third day since this happened. Moreover\, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning and did not find His body; and they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels\, who said that He was alive. Some of those who were with us went to the tomb\, and found it just as the women had said; but Him they did not see.\" And He said to them\, \"O foolish men\, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Was not it necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into this glory?\" And beginning with Moses and all the prophets\, He interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning Himself. So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He appeared to be going further\, but they constrained Him\, saying\, \"Stay with us\, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.\" So He went in to stay with them. When He was at table with them\, He took the bread and blessed\, and broke it\, and gave it to them. And their eyes were opened and they recognized Him; and He vanished out of their sight. They said to each other\, \"Did not our hearts burn within us while He talked to us on the road\, while He opened to us the scriptures?\" And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven gathered together and those who were with them\, who said\, \"The Lord has risen indeed\, and has appeared to Simon!\" Then they told what had happened on the road and how He was known to them in the breaking of the bread.\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 9:32-42\nIn those days\, as Peter went here and there among them all\, he came down also to the saints that lived at Lydda. There he found a man named Aeneas\, who had been bedridden for eight years and was paralyzed. And Peter said to him\, \"Aeneas\, Jesus Christ heals you; rise and make your bed.\" And immediately he rose. And all the residents of Lydda and Sharon saw him\, and they turned to the Lord. Now there was at Joppa a disciple named Tabitha\, which means Dorcas. She was full of good works and acts of charity. In those days she fell sick and died; and when they had washed her\, they laid her in an upper room. Since Lydda was near Joppa\, the disciples\, hearing that Peter was there\, sent two men to him entreating him\, \"Please come to us without delay.\" So Peter rose and went with them. And when he had come\, they took him to the upper room. All the widows stood beside him weeping\, and showing tunics and other garments which Dorcas made while she was with them. But Peter put them all outside and knelt down and prayed; then turning to the body he said\, \"Tabitha\, rise.\" And she opened her eyes\, and when she saw Peter she sat up. And he gave her his hand and lifted her up. Then calling the saints and widows he presented her alive. And it became known throughout all Joppa\, and many believed in the Lord.\n\nGospel Reading: John 5:1-15\nAt that time\, Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool\, in Hebrew called Bethesda which has five porticoes. In these lay a multitude of invalids\, blind\, lame\, paralyzed\, waiting for the moving of the water; for an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the pool\, and troubled the water; whoever stepped in first after the troubling of the water was healed of whatever disease he had. One man was there\, who had been ill for thirty-eight years. When Jesus saw him and knew that he had been lying there a long time\, he said to him\, \"Do you want to be healed?\" The sick man answered him\, \"Sir\, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is troubled\, and while I am going another steps down before me.\" Jesus said to him\, \"Rise\, take up your pallet\, and walk.\" And at once the man was healed\, and he took up his pallet and walked.\n\nNow that day was the sabbath. So the Jews said to the man who was cured\, \"It is the sabbath\, it is not lawful for you to carry your pallet.\" But he answered them\, \"The man who healed me said to me\, 'Take up your pallet\, and walk.' \"They asked him\, \"Who is the man who said to you\, 'Take up your pallet\, and walk'?\" Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was\, for Jesus had withdrawn\, as there was a crowd in the place. Afterward\, Jesus found him in the temple\, and said to him\, \"See\, you are well! Sin no more\, that nothing worse befall you.\" The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him.\n\n

SUMMARY:4th Monday after Pascha
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 05/12/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: 4th Monday after Pascha; Epiphanius\, Bishop of Cyprus; Germanos\, Patriarch of Constantinople; Removal of the Sacred Relics of Saint Joachim \"Papoulakis\" of Vatopaidi; Theodorus the Righteous of Cythera\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 10:1-16\nIn those days\, at Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius\, a centurion of what was known as the Italian Cohort\, a devout man who feared God with all his household\, gave alms liberally to the people\, and prayed constantly to God. About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God coming in and saying to him\, \"Cornelius.\" And he stared at him in terror\, and said\, \"What is it\, Lord?\" And he said to him\, \"Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before God. And now send men to Joppa\, and bring one Simon who is called Peter; he is lodging with Simon\, a tanner\, whose house is by the seaside.\" When the angel who spoke to him had departed\, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those that waited on him\, and having related everything to them\, he sent them to Joppa. The next day\, as they were on their journey and coming near the city\, Peter went up on the housetop to pray\, about the sixth hour. And he became hungry and desired something to eat; but while they were preparing it\, he fell into a trance and saw the heaven opened\, and something descending\, like a great sheet\, let down by four corners upon the earth. In it were all kinds of animals and reptiles and birds of the air. And there came a voice to him\, \"Rise\, Peter; kill and eat.\" But Peter said\, \"No\, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.\" And the voice came to him again a second time\, \"What God has cleansed\, you must not call common.\" This happened three times\, and the thing was taken up at once to heaven.\n\nGospel Reading: John 6:56-69\nThe Lord said to the Jews who had believed in him\, \"He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me\, and I in him. As the living Father sent me\, and I live because of the Father\, so he who eats me will live because of me. This is the bread which came down from heaven\, not such as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread will live forever.\" This he said in the synagogue\, as he taught at Capernaum.\n\nMany of his disciples\, when they heard it\, said\, \"This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?\" But Jesus\, knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at it\, said to them\, \"Do you take offense at this?\" Then what if you were to see the Son of man ascending where he was before? It is the spirit that gives life\, the flesh is of no avail; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. But there are some of you that do not believe.\" For Jesus knew from the first who those were that did not believe\, and who it was that would betray him. And he said\, \"This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.\"\n\nAfter this many of his disciples drew back and no longer went about with him. Jesus said to the twelve\, \"Do you also wish to go away?\" Simon Peter answered him\, \"Lord\, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life; and we have believed\, and have come to know\, that you are Christ\, the Son of the living God.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:4th Tuesday after Pascha
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 05/13/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: 4th Tuesday after Pascha; The Holy Martyr Glyceria; Sergios the Confessor; Alexandros the Martyr; Pausikakos\, Bishop of Synnada\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 10:21-33\nIn those days\, Peter went down to the men sent by Cornelius to him and said\, \"I am the one you are looking for; what is the reason for your coming?\" And they said\, \"Cornelius\, a centurion\, an upright and God-fearing man\, who is well-spoken of by the whole Jewish nation\, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house\, and to hear what you have to say.\" So he called them in to be his guests. The next day he rose and went off with them\, and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him. And on the following day they entered Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his kinsmen and close friends. When Peter entered\, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him. But Peter lifted him up\, saying\, \"Stand up; I too am a man.\" And as he talked with him\, he went in and found many persons gathered; and he said to them\, \"You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with or to visit any one of another nation; but God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean. So when I was sent for\, I came without objection. I ask then why you sent for me.\" And Cornelius said\, \"Four days ago\, about this hour\, I was keeping the ninth hour of prayer in my house; and behold\, a man stood before me in bright apparel\, saying\, 'Cornelius\, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God. Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is called Peter; he is lodging in the house of Simon\, a tanner\, by the seaside.' So I sent to you at once\, and you have been kind enough to come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God\, to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord.\"\n\nGospel Reading: John 7:1-13\nAt that time\, Jesus went about in Galilee; he would not go about in Judea\, because the Jews sought to kill him. Now the Jews' feast of Tabernacles was at hand. So his brothers said to him\, \"Leave here and go to Judea\, that your disciples may see the works you are doing. For no man works in secret if he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things\, show yourself to the world.\" For even his brothers did not believe in him. Jesus said to them\, \"My time has not yet come\, but your time is always here. The world cannot hate you\, but it hates me because I testify of it that its works are evil. Go to the feast yourselves; I am not going up to this feast\, for my time has not yet fully come.\" So saying\, he remained in Galilee.\n\nBut after his brothers had gone up to the feast\, then he also went up\, not publicly but in private. The Jews were looking for him at the feast\, and saying\, \"Where is he?\" And there was much muttering about him among the people. While some said\, \"He is a good man\,\" others said\, \"No\, he is leading the people astray.\" Yet for fear of the Jews no one spoke openly of him.\n\n

SUMMARY:4th Wednesday after Pascha - Mid-Pentecost
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 05/14/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: 4th Wednesday after Pascha - Mid-Pentecost; Isidore the Martyr of Chios; Holy Hieromartyr Therapontus; Holy New Martyrs Mark and John; Leontius\, Patriarch of Jerusalem; Serapion the Holy Martyr\n\nFast Day (Fish Allowed)\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 14:6-18\nIn those days\, the apostles fled to Lystra and Derbe\, cities of Lycaonia\, and to the surrounding country; and there they preached the gospel. Now at Lystra there was a man sitting\, who could not use his feet; he was a cripple from birth\, who had never walked. He listened to Paul speaking; and Paul\, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well\, said in a loud voice\, \"Stand upright on your feet.\" And he sprang up and walked. And when the crowds saw what Paul had done\, they lifted up their voices\, saying in Lycaonian\, \"The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!\" Barnabas they called Zeus\, and Paul\, because he was the chief speaker\, they called Hermes. And the priest of Zeus\, whose temple was in front of the city\, brought oxen and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifice with the people. But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it\, they tore their garments and rushed out among the multitude\, crying\, \"Men\, why are you doing this? We also are men\, of like nature with you\, and bring you good news\, that you should turn from these vain things to a living God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them. In past generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways; yet he did not leave himself without witness\, for he did good and gave you from heaven rains and fruitful seasons\, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.\" With these words they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifice to them.\n\nGospel Reading: John 7:14-30\nAbout the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught. The Jews marveled at it saying\, \"How is it that this man has learning\, when he has never studied?\" So Jesus answered them\, \"My teaching is not mine\, but his who sent me; if any man's will is to do his will\, he shall know whether the teacher is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority. He who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory; but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true\, and in him there is not falsehood. Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?\" The people answered\, \"You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?\" Jesus answered them\, \"I did one deed\, and you all marvel at it. Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses\, but from the fathers)\, and you circumcise a man upon the sabbath. If on the sabbath a man receives circumcision\, so that the law of Moses may not be broken\, are you angry with me because on the sabbath I made a man's whole body well? Do not judge by appearances\, but judge with right judgment.\"\n\nSome of the people of Jerusalem therefore said\, \"Is not this the man whom they seek to kill? And here he is\, speaking openly\, and they say nothing to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that this is the Christ? Yet we know where this man comes from; and when the Christ appears\, no one will know where he comes from.\" So Jesus proclaimed\, as he taught in the temple\, \"You know me\, and you know where I come from? But I have not come of my own accord; he who sent me is true\, and him you do not know. I know him\, for I come from him\, and he sent me.\" So they sought to arrest him; but no one laid hands on him\, because his hour had not yet come.\n\n

You know the word which he sent to Israel\, preaching good news of peace by Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all)\, the word which was proclaimed throughout all Judea\, beginning from Galilee after the baptism which John preached: how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed by the devil\, for God was with him. And we are witnesses to all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree; but God raised him on the third day and made him manifest; not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses\, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. And he commanded us to preach to the people\, and to testify that he is the one ordained by God to be judge of the living and the dead. To him all the prophets bear witness that every one who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.\"\n\nGospel Reading: John 8:12-20\nAgain Jesus spoke to them\, saying\, \"I am the light of the world; he who follows me will not walk in darkness\, but will have the light of life.\" The Pharisees then said to him\, \"You are bearing witness to yourself; your testimony is not true.\" Jesus answered\, \"Even if I do bear witness to myself\, my testimony is true\, for I know whence I have come and whither I am going\, but you do not know whence I come or whither I am going. You judge according to the flesh\, I judge no one. Yet even if I do judge\, my judgment is true\, for it is not I alone that judge\, but I and he who sent me. In your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true; I bear witness to myself\, and the Father who sent me bears witness to me.\" They said to him therefore\, \"Where is your Father?\" Jesus answered\, \"You know neither me nor my Father; if you knew me\, you would know my Father also.\" These words he spoke in the treasury\, as he taught in the temple; but no one arrested him\, because his hour had not yet come.\n\n

And the believers from among the circumcised who came with Peter were amazed\, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles. For they heard them speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter declared\, \"Can any one forbid water for baptizing these people who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?\" And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain for some days. Now the apostles and the brethren who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. So when Peter went up to Jerusalem\, the circumcision party criticized him\, saying\, \"Why did you go to uncircumcised men and eat with them?\" But Peter began and explained to them in order: \"I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision\, something descending\, like a great sheet\, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came down to me. Looking at it closely I observed animals and beasts of prey and reptiles and birds of the air. And I heard a voice saying to me\, 'Rise\, Peter; kill and eat.' But I said\, 'No\, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.' But the voice answered a second time from heaven\, 'What God has cleansed you must not call common.' This happened three times\, and all was drawn up again into heaven.\"\n\nGospel Reading: John 8:21-30\nThe Lord said to the Jews who came to him\, \"I go away\, and you will seek me and die in your sin; where I am going\, you cannot come.\" Then said the Jews\, \"Will he kill himself\, since he says\, 'Where I am going\, you cannot come'? \" He said to them\, \"You are from below\, I am from above; you are of this world\, I am not of this world. I told you that you would die in your sins\, for you will die in your sins unless you believe that I am he.\" They said to him\, \"Who are you?\" Jesus said to them\, \"Even what I have told you from the beginning. I have much to say about you and much to judge; but he who sent me is true\, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.\" They did not understand that he spoke to them of the Father. So Jesus said\, \"When you have lifted up the Son of man\, then you will know that I am he\, and that I do nothing on my own authority but speak thus as the Father taught me. And he who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone\, for I always do what is pleasing to him.\" As he spoke thus\, many believed in him.\n\n

He killed James the brother of John with the sword; and when he saw that it pleased the Jews\, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the days of Unleavened Bread. And when he had seized him\, he put him in prison\, and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to guard him\, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people. So Peter was kept in prison; but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the Church.\n\nThe very night when Herod was about to bring him out\, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers\, bound with two chains\, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison; and behold\, an angel of the Lord appeared\, and a light shone in the cell; and he struck Peter on the side and woke him\, saying\, \"Get up quickly.\" And the chains fell off his hands. And the angel said to him\, \"Wrap your mantle around you and follow me.\" And he went out and followed him; he did not know that what was done by the angel was real\, but thought he was seeing a vision. When they had passed the first and the second guard\, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. It opened to them of its own accord\, and they went out and passed on through one street; and immediately the angel left him. And Peter came to himself\, and said\, \"Now I am sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.\"\n\nGospel Reading: John 8:31-42\nThe Lord said to the Jews who had believed in him\, \"If you continue in my word\, you are truly my disciples\, and you will know the truth\, and the truth will make you free.\" They answered him\, \"We are descendants of Abraham\, and have never been in bondage to any one. How is it that you say\, 'You will be made free'?\"\n\nJesus answered them\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, every one who commits sin is a slave to sin. The slave does not continue in the house for ever; the son continues for ever. So if the Son makes you free\, you will be free indeed. I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you seek to kill me\, because my word finds no place in you. I speak of what I have seen with my Father\, and you do what you have heard from your father.\"\n\nThey answered him\, \"Abraham is our father.\" Jesus said to them\, \"If you were Abraham's children\, you would do what Abraham did\, but now you seek to kill me\, a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God; this is not what Abraham did. You do what your father did.\" They said to him\, \"We were not born of fornication; we have one Father\, even God.\" Jesus said to them\, \"If God were your Father\, you would love me\, for I proceeded and came forth from God; I came not of my own accord\, but he sent me.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Sunday of the Samaritan Woman
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 05/18/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Sunday of the Samaritan Woman; Holy Martyrs: Peter\, Dionysius\, Andrew\, Paul\, Christina\, Heraclius\, Paulinus and Benedimus; Stephen I\, Patriarch of Constantinople; Julian the Martyr; Euphrasia the Martyr of Nicea\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: John 20:1-10\nOn the first day of the week\, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early\, while it was still dark\, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb. So she ran\, and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple\, the one whom Jesus loved\, and said to them\, \"They have taken the Lord out of the tomb\, and we do not know where they have laid Him.\" Peter then came out with the other disciple\, and they went toward the tomb. They both ran\, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first; and stooping to look in\, he saw the linen cloths lying there\, but he did not go in. Then Simon Peter came\, following him\, and went into the tomb; he saw the linen cloths lying and the napkin\, which had been on His head\, not lying with the linen cloths\, but rolled up in a place by itself. Then the other disciple\, who reached the tomb first\, also went in\, and he saw and believed; for as yet they did not know the scripture\, that He must rise from the dead. Then the disciples went back to their homes.\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 11:19-30\nIn those days\, those apostles who were scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch\, speaking the word to none except Jews. But there were some of them\, men of Cyprus and Cyrene\, who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Greeks also\, preaching the Lord Jesus. And the hand of the Lord was with them\, and a great number that believed turned to the Lord. News of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem\, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. When he came and saw the grace of God\, he was glad; and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose; for he was a good man\, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a large company was added to the Lord. So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul; and when he had found him\, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church\, and taught a large company of people; and in Antioch the disciples were for the first time called Christians. Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. And one of them named Agabos stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine over all the world; and this took place in the days of Claudius. And the disciples determined\, every one according to his ability\, to send relief to the brethren who lived in Judea\, and they did so\, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.\n\nGospel Reading: John 4:5-42\nAt that time\, Jesus came to a city of Samaria\, called Sychar\, near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Jacob's well was there\, and so Jesus\, wearied as he was with his journey\, sat down beside the well. It was about the sixth hour.\n\nThere came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her\, \"Give me a drink.\" For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food. The Samaritan woman said to him\, \"How is it that you\, a Jew\, ask a drink of me\, a woman of Samaria?\" For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans. Jesus answered her\, \"If you knew the gift of God\, and who it is that is saying to you\, 'Give me a drink\,' you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.\" The woman said to him\, \"Sir\, you have nothing to draw with\, and the well is deep; where do you get that living water? Are you greater than our father Jacob\, who gave us the well\, and drank from it himself\, and his sons\, and his cattle?\" Jesus said to her\, \"Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again\, but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst; the water that I shall give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.\" The woman said to him\, \"Sir\, give me this water\, that I may not thirst\, nor come here to draw.\"\n\nJesus said to her\, \"Go\, call your husband\, and come here.\" The woman answered him\, \"I have no husband.\" Jesus said to her\, \"You are right in saying\, 'I have no husband'; for you have had five husbands\, and he whom you now have is not your husband; this you said truly.\" The woman said to him\, \"Sir\, I perceive that you are a prophet. Our fathers worshiped on this mountain; and you say that Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.\" Jesus said to her\, \"Woman\, believe me\, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know\, for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is coming\, and now is\, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth\, for such the Father seeks to worship him. God is spirit\, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.\" The woman said to him\, \"I know that the Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ); when he comes\, he will show us all things.\" Jesus said to her\, \"I who speak to you am he.\"\n\nJust then his disciples came. They marveled that he was talking with a woman\, but none said\, \"What do you wish?\" or\, \"Why are you talking with her?\" So the woman left her water jar\, and went away into the city and said to the people\, \"Come\, see a man who told me all that I ever did. Can this be the Christ?\" They went out of the city and were coming to him.\n\nMeanwhile the disciples besought him\, saying \"Rabbi\, eat.\" But he said to them\, \"I have food to eat of which you do not know.\" So the disciples said to one another\, \"Has anyone brought him food?\" Jesus said to them\, \"My food is to do the will of him who sent me\, and to accomplish his work. Do you not say\, 'There are yet four months\, then comes the harvest'? I tell you\, lift up your eyes\, and see how the fields are already white for harvest. He who reaps receives wages\, and gathers fruit for eternal life\, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together. For here the saying holds true\, 'One sows and another reaps.' I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor; others have labored\, and you have entered into their labor.\"\n\nMany Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the woman's testimony. \"He told me all that I ever did.\" So when the Samaritans came to him\, they asked him to stay with them; and he stayed there two days. And many more believed because of his word. They said to the woman\, \"It is no longer because of your words that we believe\, for we have heard ourselves\, and we know that this is indeed Christ the Savior of the world.\"\n\n

And when he knocked at the door of the gateway\, a maid named Rhoda came to answer. Recognizing Peter's voice\, in her joy she did not open the gate but ran and told that Peter was standing at the gate. They said to her\, \"You are mad.\" But she insisted that it was so. They said\, \"It is his angel!\" But Peter continued knocking; and when they opened\, they saw him and were amazed. But motioning to them with his hand to be silent\, he described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said\, \"Tell this to James and to the brethren.\" Then he departed and went to another place.\n\nGospel Reading: John 8:42-51\nThe Lord said to the Jews who came to him\, \"If God were your Father\, you would love me\, for I proceeded and came forth from God; I came not of my own accord\, but he sent me. Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to hear my word. You are of your father the devil\, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning\, and has nothing to do with the truth\, because there is no truth in him. When he lies\, he speaks according to his own nature\, for he is a liar and the father of lies. But\, because I tell the truth\, you do not believe me. Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth\, why do you not believe me? He who is of God hears the words of God; the reason why you do not hear them is that you are not of God.\"\n\nThe Jews answered him\, \"Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?\" Jesus answered\, \"I have not a demon; but I honor my Father\, and you dishonor me. Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it and he will be the judge. Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, if any one keeps my word\, he will never see death.\"\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 05/20/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: The Holy Martyr Thalleleus; Lydia of Philippi\, Equal to the Apostles; Mark the Hermit; Father Alexis\, Metropolitan of Moscow; John\, Joseph\, and Nikitas the Monks of Chios\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 12:25;13.1-12\nIn those days\, Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their mission\, bringing with them John whose other name was Mark. Now in the Church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers\, Barnabas\, Simeon who was called Niger\, Lucius of Cyrene\, Manaen a member of the court of Herod the tetrarch\, and Saul. While they were worshipping the Lord and fasting\, the Holy Spirit said\, \"Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.\" Then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off. So\, being sent out by the Holy Spirit\, they went down to Seleucia; and from there they sailed to Cyprus. When they arrived at Salamis\, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John to assist them. When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos\, they came upon a certain magician\, a Jewish false prophet\, named Bar-Jesus. He was with the proconsul\, Sergius Paulus\, a man of intelligence\, who summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God. But Elymas the magician (for that is the meaning of his name) withstood them\, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith. But Saul\, who is also called Paul\, filled with the Holy Spirit\, looked intently at him and said\, \"You son of the devil\, you enemy of all righteousness\, full of all deceit and villainy\, will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord? And now\, behold\, the hand of the Lord is upon you\, and you shall be blind and unable to see the sun for a time.\" Immediately mist and darkness fell upon him and he went about seeking people to lead him by the hand. Then the proconsul believed\, when he saw what had occurred\, for he was astonished at the teaching of the Lord.\n\nGospel Reading: John 8:51-59\nThe Lord said to the Jews who came to him\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, if any one keeps my word\, he will never see death.\" The Jews said to him\, \"Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died\, as did the prophets; and you say\, 'If any one keeps my word\, he will never taste death.' Are you greater than our father Abraham\, who died? And the prophets died! Who do you claim to be?\" Jesus answered\, \"If I glorify myself\, my glory is nothing; it is my Father who glorifies me\, of whom you say that he is your God. But you have not known him; I know him. If I said\, I do not know him\, I should be a liar like you; but I do know him and I keep his word. Your father Abraham rejoiced that he was to see my day; and he saw it and was glad.\" The Jews then said to him\, \"You are not yet fifty years old\, and have you seen Abraham?\" Jesus said to them\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, before Abraham was\, I am.\" So they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself\, and went out of the temple.\n\n

The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came that they may have life\, and have it abundantly.  I am the good shepherd.  The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.  He who is a hireling and not a shepherd\, whose own the sheep are not\, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.  He flees because he is a hireling and cares nothing for the sheep.  I am the good shepherd; I know my own and my own know me\, as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.  And I have other sheep\, that are not of this fold; I must bring them also\, and they will heed my voice. So there shall be one flock\, one shepherd.\"\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 26:1\,12-20\nIN THOSE DAYS\, King Agrippa said to Paul\, \"You have permission to speak for yourself.\" Then Paul stretched out his hand and made his defense: \"I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests. At midday\, O king\, I saw on the way a light from heaven\, brighter than the sun\, shining round me and those who journeyed with me. And when we had all fallen to the ground\, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language\, 'Saul\, Saul\, why do you persecute me? It hurts you to kick against the goads.' And I said\, 'Who are you\, Lord?' And the Lord said\, 'I am Jesus whom you are persecuting. But rise and stand upon your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose\, to appoint you to serve and bear witness to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which I will appear to you\, delivering you from the people and from the Gentiles-to whom I send you to open their eyes\, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God\, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.' \"Wherefore\, O King Agrippa\, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision\, but declared first to those at Damascus\, then at Jerusalem and throughout all the country of Judea\, and also to the Gentiles\, that they should repent and turn to God and perform deeds worthy of their repentance.\" \n\nGospel Reading: John 10:1-9\nThe Lord said to the Jews who had come to him\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way\, that man is a thief and a robber; but he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the gatekeeper opens; the sheep hear his voice\, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own\, he goes before them\, and the sheep follow him\, for they know his voice. A stranger they will not follow\, but they will flee from him\, for they do not know the voice of strangers.\" This figure Jesus used with them\, but they did not understand what he was saying to them. So Jesus again said to them\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, I am the door of the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not heed them. I am the door; if any one enters by me\, he will be saved\, and will go in and out and find pasture.\"\n\n

When they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples\, they returned to Lystra and to lconion and to Antioch\, strengthening the souls of the disciples\, exhorting them to continue in the faith\, and saying that through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God. And when they had appointed elders for them in every church\, with prayer and fasting they committed them to the Lord in whom they believed. Then they passed through Pisidia\, and came to Pamphylia. And when they had spoken the word in Perga\, they went down to Attalia; and from there they sailed to Antioch\, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled. And when they arrived\, they gathered the church together and declared all that God had done with them\, and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles. And they remained no little time with the disciples. But some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brethren\, \"Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses\, you cannot be saved.\" And when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them\, Paul and Barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and the elders about this question. So\, being sent on their way by the church\, they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria\, reporting the conversion of the Gentiles\, and they gave great joy to all the brethren. And when they came to Jerusalem\, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders\, and they declared all that God had done with them. \n\nGospel Reading: John 9:39-10:9\nThe Lord said to the Jews who came to him\, \"For judgment I came into this world\, that those who do not see may see\, and that those who see may become blind.\" Some of the Pharisees near him heard this\, and they said to him\, \"Are we also blind?\" Jesus said to them\, \"If you were blind\, you would have no guilt; but now that you say\, 'We see\,' your guilt remains.\n\n\"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way\, that man is a thief and a robber; but he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.

And after there had been much debate\, Peter rose and said to them\, \"Brethren\, you know that in the early days God made choice among you\, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe. And God who knows the heart bore witness to them\, giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us; and he made no distinction between us and them\, but cleansed their hearts by faith. Now therefore why do you make trial of God by putting a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear? But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus\, just as they will.\" And all the assembly kept silence; and they listened to Barnabas and Paul as they related what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles. \n\nGospel Reading: John 10:17-28\nThe Lord said to the Jews who came to him\, \"For this reason the Father loves me\, because I lay down my life\, that I may take it again. No one takes it from me\, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down\, and I have power to take it again; this charge I have received from my Father.\" \n\nThere was again a division among the Jews because of these words. Many of them said\, \"He has a demon\, and he is mad; why listen to him?\" Others said\, \"These are not the sayings of one who has a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?\"\n\nIt was the feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem; it was winter\, and Jesus was walking in the temple\, in the portico of Solomon. So the Jews gathered round him and said to him\, \"How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ\, tell us plainly.\" Jesus answered them\, \"I told you\, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name\, they bear witness to me; but you do not believe\, because you do not belong to my sheep. My sheep hear my voice\, and I know them\, and they follow me; and I give them eternal life.\"\n\n

And after some days Paul said to Barnabas\, \"Come\, let us return and visit the brethren in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord\, and see how they are.\" And Barnabas wanted to take with them John called Mark. But Paul thought best not to take with them one who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia\, and had not gone with them to the work. And there arose a sharp contention\, so that they separated from each other; Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus\, but Paul chose Silas and departed\, being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord. And he went through Syria and Cilicia\, strengthening the churches. \n\nGospel Reading: John 10:27-38\nThe Lord said to the Jews who came to him\, \"My sheep hear my voice\, and I know them\, and they follow me; and I give them eternal life\, and they shall never perish\, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand. My Father\, who has given them to me\, is greater than all\, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand. I and the Father are one.\"\n\nThe Jews took up stones again to stone him. Jesus answered them\, \"I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of these do you stone me?\" The Jews answered him\, \"It is not for a good work that we stone you but for blasphemy; because you\, being a man\, make yourself God.\" Jesus answered them\, \"Is it not written in your law\, 'I said\, you are gods?' If he called them gods to whom the word of God came (and scripture cannot be broken)\, do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world\, 'You are blaspheming\,' because I said\, 'I am the Son of God'? If I am not doing the works of my Father\, then do not believe me; but if I do them\, even though you do not believe me\, believe my works\, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.\"\n\n

They said to her\, \"Woman\, why are you weeping?\" She said to them\, \"Because they have taken away my Lord\, and I do not know where they have laid Him.\" Saying this\, she turned round and saw Jesus standing\, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her\, \"Woman\, why are you weeping? Whom do you seek?\" Supposing Him to be the gardener\, she said to Him\, \"Sir\, if you have carried Him away\, tell me where you have laid Him\, and I will take Him away.\" Jesus said to her\, \"Mary.\" She turned and said to Him in Hebrew\, \"Rabboni\,\" which means Teacher. Jesus said to her\, \"Do not touch Me\, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brethren and say to them\, I am ascending to My Father and your Father\, to My God and your God.\" Mary Magdalene went and said to the disciples\, \"I have seen the Lord\,\" and she told them that He had said these things to her.\n\nEpistle Reading: II Corinthians 4:6-15\nBrethren\, it is the God who said\, \"Let light shine out of darkness\,\" who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.\n\nBut we have this treasure in earthen vessels\, to show that the transcendent power belongs to God and not to us.  We are afflicted in every way\, but not crushed; perplexed\, but not driven to despair; persecuted\, but not forsaken; struck down\, but not destroyed; always carrying in the body the death of Jesus\, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies.  For while we live we are always being given up to death for Jesus' sake\, so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.  So death is at work in us\, but life in you.\n\nSince we have the same spirit of faith as he had who wrote\, \"I believed\, and so I spoke\,\" we too believe\, and so we speak\, knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence.  For it is all for your sake\, so that as grace extends to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving\, to the glory of God.\n\nGospel Reading: John 9:1-38\nAt that time\, as Jesus passed by\, he saw a man blind from his birth. And his disciples asked him\, \"Rabbi\, who sinned\, this man or his parents\, that he was born blind?\" Jesus answered\, \"It was not that this man sinned\, or his parents\, but that the works of God might be made manifest in him. We must work the works of him who sent me\, while it is day; night comes\, when no one can work. As long as I am in the world\, I am the light of the world.\" As he said this\, he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and anointed the man's eyes with the clay\, saying to him\, \"Go\, wash in the pool of Siloam\" (which means Sent). So he went and washed and came back seeing. The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar\, said\, \"Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?\" Some said\, \"It is he\"; others said\, \"No\, but he is like him.\" He said\, \"I am the man.\" They said to him\, \"Then how were your eyes opened?\" He answered\, \"The man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me\, 'Go to Siloam and wash'; so I went and washed and received my sight.\" They said to him\, \"Where is he?\" He said\, \"I do not know.\"\n\nThey brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind. Now it was a sabbath day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes. The Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight. And he said to them\, \"He put clay on my eyes and I washed\, and I see.\" Some of the Pharisees said\, \"This man is not from God\, for he does not keep the sabbath.\" But others said\, \"How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?\" There was a division among them. So they again said to the blind man\, \"What do you say about him\, since he has opened your eyes?\" He said\, \"He is a prophet.\"\n\nThe Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight\, until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight\, and asked them\, \"Is this your son\, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?\" His parents answered\, \"We know that this is our son\, and that he was born blind; but how he now sees we do not know\, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age\, he will speak for himself.\" His parents said this because they feared the Jews\, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should confess him to be Christ he was to be put out of the synagogue. Therefore his parents said\, \"He is of age\, ask him.\"\n\nSo for the second time they called the man who had been blind\, and said to him\, \"Give God the praise; we know that this man is a sinner.\" He answered\, \"Whether he is a sinner\, I do not know; one thing I know\, that though I was blind\, now I see.\" They said to him\, \"What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\" He answered them\, \"I have told you already and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you too want to become his disciples?\" And they reviled him\, saying\, \"You are his disciple\, but we are disciples of Moses. We know that God has spoken to Moses\, but as for this man\, we do not know where he comes from.\" The man answered\, \"Why\, this is a marvel! You do not know where he comes from\, and yet he opened my eyes. We know that God does not listen to sinners\, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does his will\, God listens to him. Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind. If this man were not from God\, he could do nothing.\" They answered him\, \"You were born in utter sin\, and would you teach us?\" And they cast him out.\n\nJesus heard that they had cast him out\, and having found him he said\, \"Do you believe in the Son of man?\" He answered\, \"And who is he\, sir\, that I may believe in him?\" Jesus said to him\, \"You have seen him\, and it is he who speaks to you.\" He said\, \"Lord\, I believe\"; and he worshiped him.\n\n

SUMMARY:6th Monday after Pascha
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 05/26/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: 6th Monday after Pascha; Carpos and Alphaeus\, Apostles of the 70; Alexandros the New Martyr of Thessaloniki; George the New of Sofia; Augustine\, Archbishop of Canterbury\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 17:1-9\nIN THOSE DAYS\, when the apostles had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia\, they came to Thessalonica\, where there was a synagogue of the Jews. And Paul went in\, as was his custom\, and for three weeks he argued with them from the scriptures\, explaining and proving that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead\, and saying\, \"This Jesus\, whom I proclaim to you\, is the Christ.\" And some of them were persuaded\, and joined Paul and Silas; as did a great many of the devout Greeks and not a few of the leading women. But the Jews were jealous\, and taking some wicked fellows of the rabble\, they gathered a crowd\, set the city in an uproar\, and attacked the house of Jason\, seeking to bring them out to the people. And when they could not find them\, they dragged Jason and some of the brethren before the city authorities\, crying\, \"These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also\, and Jason has received them; and they are all acting against the decrees of Caesar\, saying that there is another king\, Jesus.\" And the people and the city authorities were disturbed when they heard this. And when they had taken security from Jason and the rest\, they let them go. \n\nGospel Reading: John 11:47-54\nAt that time\, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the council\, and said\, \"What are we to do? For this man performs many signs. If we let him go on thus\, every one will believe in him\, and the Romans will come and destroy both our place and our nation.\" But one of them\, Caiaphas\, who was high priest that year\, said to them\, \"You know nothing at all; you do not understand that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people\, and that the whole nation should not perish.\" He did not say this of his own accord\, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation\, and not for the nation only\, but to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad. So from that day on they took counsel how to put him to death.\n\nJesus therefore no longer went about openly among the Jews\, but went from there to the country near the wilderness\, to a town called Ephraim; and there he stayed with the disciples.\n\n

SUMMARY:The Holy Hieromartyr Helladius
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 05/27/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: The Holy Hieromartyr Helladius; John the Russian of Evia; Theodora the Virgin-martyr & Didymos the Martyr; Venerable Bede\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 17:19-28\nIN THOSE DAYS\, the Athenians took hold of Paul and brought him to the Areopagos\, saying\, \"May we know what this new teaching is which you present? For you bring some strange things to our ears; we wish to know therefore what these things mean.\" Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new. So Paul\, standing in the middle of the Areopagos\, said: \"Men of Athens\, I perceive that in every way you are very religious. For as I passed along\, and observed the objects of your worship\, I found also an altar with this inscription\, 'To an unknown god.' What therefore you worship as unknown\, this I proclaim to you. The God who made the world and everything in it\, being Lord of heaven and earth\, does not live in shrines made by man\, nor is he served by human hands\, as though he needed anything\, since he himself gives to all men life and breath and everything. And he made from one every nation of men to live on all the face of the earth\, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their habitation\, that they should seek God\, in the hope that they might feel after him and find him. Yet he is not far from each one of us\, for 'In him we live and move and have our being.' \n\nGospel Reading: John 12:19-36\nAt that time\, the Pharisees took counsel against Jesus and said to one another\, \"You see that you can do nothing; look\, the world has gone after him.\"\n\nNow among those who went up to worship at the feast were some Greeks. So these came to Philip\, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee\, and said to him\, \"Sir\, we wish to see Jesus.\" Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew went with Philip and they told Jesus. And Jesus answered them\, \"The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified. Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies\, it remains alone; but if it dies\, it bears much fruit. He who loves his life loses it\, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. If any one serves me\, he must follow me; and where I am\, there shall my servant be also; if any one serves me\, the Father will honor him.\n\n\"Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? 'Father\, save me from this hour?' No\, for this purpose I have come to this hour. Father\, glorify your name.\" Then a voice came from heaven\, \"I have glorified it\, and I will glorify it again.\" The crowd standing by heard it and said that it had thundered. Others said\, \"An angel has spoken to him.\" Jesus answered\, \"This voice has come for your sake\, not for mine. Now is the judgment of this world\, now shall the ruler of this world be cast out; and I\, when I am lifted up from the earth\, will draw all men to myself.\" He said this to show by what death he was to die. The crowd answered him\, \"We have heard from the law that the Christ remains for ever. How can you say that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?\" Jesus said to them\, \"The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light\, lest the darkness overtake you; he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes. While you have the light\, believe in the light\, that you may become sons of light.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Apodosis of Pascha
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 05/28/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Apodosis of Pascha; Hieromartyr Eutychius\, Bishop of Melitene; Nikitas\, Bishop of Chalcedon; Helikonis the Martyr; Heladios the Hieromartyr of the East; Zacharias the New Martyr\n\nFast Day (Fish Allowed)\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 18:22-28\nIN THOSE DAYS\, when Paul had landed at Caesarea\, he went up and greeted the church\, and then went down to Antioch. After spending some time there he departed and went from place to place through the region of Galatia and Phrygia\, strengthening all the disciples. Now a Jew named Apollos\, a native of Alexandria\, came to Ephesos. He was an eloquent man\, well versed in the scriptures. He had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit\, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus\, though he knew only the baptism of John. He began to speak boldly in the synagogue; but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him\, they took him and expounded to him the way of God more accurately. And when he wished to cross to Achaia\, the brethren encouraged him\, and wrote to the disciples to receive him. When he arrived\, he greatly helped those who through grace had believed\, for he powerfully confuted the Jews in public\, showing by the scriptures that the Christ was Jesus. \n\nGospel Reading: John 12:36-47\nThe Lord said to the Jews who came to him\, \"While you have the light\, believe in the light\, that you may become sons of light. When Jesus had said this\, he departed and hid himself from them. Though he had done so many signs before them\, yet they did not believe in him; it was that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: \"Lord\, who has believed our report\, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?\" Therefore they could not believe. For Isaiah again said\, \"He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart\, lest they should see with their eyes and perceive with their heart\, and turn for me to heal them.\" Isaiah said this because he saw his glory and spoke of him. Nevertheless\, many even of the authorities believed in him\, but for fear of the Pharisees they did not confess it\, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.\n\nAnd Jesus cried out and said\, \"He who believes in me\, believes not in me but in him who sent me. And he who sees me sees him who sent me. I have come as light into the world\, that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness. If any one hears my sayings and does not keep them\, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Holy Ascension
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 05/29/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Holy Ascension; Theodosia the Virgin-Martyr of Tyre; Theodosia\, Virgin-Martyr of Constantinople; Seven New Martyrs of Kastoria; Andrew the New Martyr of Argentes; John of Smyrna the New Martyr\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Mark 16:9-20\nWhen Jesus rose early on the first day of the week\, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene\, from whom He had cast out seven demons. She went and told those who had been with Him\, as they mourned and wept. But when they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her\, they would not believe it.\n\nAfter this he appeared in another form to two of them\, as they were walking into the country. And they went back and told the rest\, but they did not believe them. After this He appeared to the eleven themselves as they sat at table and He upbraided them for their unbelief and hardness of heart\, because they had not believed those who saw Him after He had risen. And He said to them\, \"Go into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation. He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned. And these signs will accompany those who believe: in My name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents\, and if they drink any deadly thing\, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick\, and they will recover.\"\n\nSo then the Lord Jesus\, after He had spoken to them\, was taken up into heaven\, and sat down at the right hand of God. And they went forth and preached everywhere\, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that attended it. Amen.\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 1:1-12\nIn the first book\, O Theophilos\, I have dealt with all that Jesus began to do and teach\, until the day when he was taken up\, after he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen. To them he presented himself alive after his passion by many proofs\, appearing to them during forty days\, and speaking of the kingdom of God. And while staying with them he charged them not to depart from Jerusalem\, but to wait for the promise of the Father\, which\, he said\, \"you heard from me\, for John baptized with water\, but before many days you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.\" So when they had come together\, they asked him\, \"Lord\, will you at this time restore the kingdom of Israel?\" He said to them\, \"it is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has fixed by his own authority. But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the end of the earth.\" And when he had said this\, as they were looking on\, he was lifted up\, and a cloud took him out of their sight. And while they were gazing into heaven as he went\, behold\, two men stood by them in white robes\, and said\,\"Men of Galilee\, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus\, who was taken up from you into heaven\, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.\" Then they returned from the mount called Olivet\, which is near Jerusalem\, a sabbath day's journey away.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 24:36-53\nAt that time\, having risen from the dead\, Jesus went up and stood among His disciples and said to them\, \"Peace be with you.\" But they were startled and frightened\, and supposed that they saw a spirit. And He said to them\, \"Why are you troubled\, and why do questionings rise in your hearts? See My hands and My feet\, that it is I Myself; handle Me\, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that I have.\" And when He had said this\, He showed them His hands and His feet. And while they still disbelieved for joy\, and wondered\, He said to them\, \"Have you anything here to eat?\" They gave Him a piece of broiled fish [and some honeycomb]\, and He took it and ate before them. Then He said to them\, \"These are My words which I spoke to you\, while I was still with you\, that everything written about Me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled.\" Then He opened their minds to understand the scriptures\, and said to them\, \"Thus it is written\, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead\, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in His name in all nations\, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. And behold\, I send the promise of My Father upon you; but stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.\" Then He led them out as far as Bethany\, and lifting up His hands\, He blessed them. While He blessed them\, He parted from them\, and was carried up into heaven. And they worshiped Him\, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy\, and were continually in the Temple blessing God.\n\n

There he found some disciples. And he said to them\, \"Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?\" And they said\, \"No\, we have never even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.\" And he said\, \"Into what then were you baptized?\" They said\, \"Into John's baptism.\" And Paul said\, \"John baptized with the baptism of repentance\, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him\, that is\, Jesus.\" On hearing this\, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid his hands upon them\, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spoke with tongues and prophesied. There were about twelve of them in all. And he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly\, arguing and pleading about the kingdom of God.\n\nGospel Reading: John 14:1-11\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"Let not your hearts be troubled; believe in God\, believe also in me. In my Father's house there are many rooms; if it were not so\, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? And when I go and prepare a place for you\, I will come again and will take you to myself\, that where I am you may be also. And you know the way where I am going.\" Thomas said to him\, \"Lord\, we do not know where you are going; how can we know the way?\" Jesus said to him\, \"I am the way\, and the truth\, and the life; no one comes to the Father\, but by me. If you had known me\, you would have known my Father also; henceforth you know him and have seen him.\"\n\nPhilip said to him\, \"Lord\, show us the Father\, and we shall be satisfied.\" Jesus said to him\, \"Have I been with you so long\, and yet you do not know me\, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father; how can you say\, 'Show us the Father?' Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority; but the Father who dwells in me does his works. Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me.\"\n\n

There were many lights in the upper chamber where we were gathered. And a young man named Euthychos was sitting in the window. He sank into a deep sleep as Paul talked still longer; and being overcome by sleep\, he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead.  But Paul went down and bent over him\, and embracing him said\, \"Do not be alarmed\, for his life is in him.\" And when Paul had gone up and had broken bread and eaten\, he conversed with them a long while\, until daybreak\, and so departed. And they took the lad away alive\, and were not a little comforted. \n\nGospel Reading: John 14:10-21\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority; but the Father who dwells in me does his works. Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me; or else believe me for the sake of the works themselves.\n\n\"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, he who believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do\, because I go to the Father. Whatever you ask in my name\, I will do it\, that the Father may be glorified in the Son; if you ask anything in my name\, I will do it. \"If you love me\, you will keep my commandments. And I will pray to the Father\, and he will give you another Counselor\, to be with you for ever\, even the Spirit of truth\, whom the world cannot receive\, because it neither sees him nor knows him; you know him\, for he dwells with you\, and will be in you.\n\n\"I will not leave you desolate; I will come to you.

SUMMARY:Fathers of the 1st Council
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 06/01/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Fathers of the 1st Council; Justin the Philosopher and Martyr and his Companions; Pyrros the Hieromartyr\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: John 21:1-14\nAt that time\, Jesus revealed Himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias; and He revealed Himself in this way. Simon Peter\, Thomas\, called the Twin\, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee\, the sons of Zebedee\, and two others of His disciples were together. Simon Peter said to them\, \"I am going fishing.\" They said to him\, \"We will go with you.\" They went out and got into the boat\, but that night they caught nothing. Just as day was breaking\, Jesus stood on the beach\, yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to them\, \"Children\, have you any fish?\" They answered him\, \"No.\" He said to them\, \"Cast the net on the right side of the boat\, and you will find some.\" So they cast it\, and now they were not able to haul it in\, for the quantity of fish. That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter\, \"It is the Lord!\" When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord\, he put on his clothes\, for he was stripped for work\, and sprang into the sea. But the other disciples came in the boat\, dragging the net full of fish\, for they were not far from the land\, but about a hundred yards off. When they got out on land\, they saw a charcoal fire there with fish lying on it\, and bread. Jesus said to them\, \"Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.\" So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore\, full of large fish\, a hundred and fifty-three of them; and although there were so many\, the net was not torn. Jesus said to them\, \"Come and have breakfast.\" Now none of the disciples dared ask Him\, \"Who are you?\" They knew it was the Lord. Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them\, and so with the fish. This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after He was raised from the dead..\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 20:16-18\,28-36\nIN THOSE DAYS\, Paul had decided to sail past Ephesos\, so that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening to be at Jerusalem\, if possible\, on the day of Pentecost. And from Miletos he sent to Ephesos and called to him the elders of the church. And when they came to him\, he said to them: \"Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock\, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers\, to care for the church of God which he obtained with the blood of his own Son. I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you\, not sparing the flock; and from among your own selves will arise men speaking perverse things\, to draw away the disciples after them. Therefore be alert\, remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to admonish every one with tears. And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace\, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified. I coveted no one's silver or gold or apparel. You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities\, and to those who were with me. In all things I have shown you that by so toiling one must help the weak\, remembering the words of the Lord Jesus\, how he said\, 'it is more blessed to give than to receive.' \" And when he had spoken thus\, he knelt down and prayed with them all. \n\nGospel Reading: John 17:1-13\nAt that time\, Jesus lifted up his eyes to heaven and said\, \"Father\, the hour has come; glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you\, since you have given him power over all flesh\, to give eternal life to all whom you have given him. And this is eternal life\, that they know you the only true God\, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. I glorified you on earth\, having accomplished the work which you gave me to do; and now\, Father\, you glorify me in your own presence with the glory which I had with you before the world was made.\n\n\"I have manifested your name to the men whom you gave me out of the world; yours they were\, and you gave them to me\, and they have kept your word. Now they know that everything that you have given me is from you; for I have given them the words which you gave me\, and they have received them and know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you did send me. I am praying for them; I am not praying for the world but for those whom you have given me\, for they are mine; all mine are yours\, and yours are mine\, and I am glorified in them. And now I am no more in the world\, but they are in the world\, and I am coming to you. Holy Father\, keep them in your name\, which you have given me\, that they may be one\, even as we are one. While I was with them\, I kept them in your name\, which you have given me; I have guarded them\, and none of them is lost but the son of perdition\, that the scripture might be fulfilled. But now I am coming to you; and these things I speak in the world\, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves.\"\n\n

And he had four unmarried daughters\, who prophesied. While we were staying for some days\, a prophet named Agabos came down from Judea. And coming to us he took Paul's girdle and bound his own feet and hands\, and said\, \"Thus says the Holy Spirit\, 'So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this girdle and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.'\" When we heard this\, we and the people there begged him not to go up to Jerusalem. Then Paul answered\, \"What are you doing\, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be imprisoned but even to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.\" And when he would not be persuaded\, we ceased and said\, \"The will of the Lord be done.\" \n\nGospel Reading: John 14:27-15:7\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"Let not your hearts be troubled\, neither let them be afraid. You heard me say to you\, 'I go away\, and I will come to you.' If you loved me\, you would have rejoiced\, because I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than I. And now I have told you before it takes place\, so that when it does take place\, you may believe. I will no longer talk much with you\, for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me; but I do as the Father has commanded me\, so that the world may know that I love the Father. Rise\, let us go hence.\n\n\"I am the true vine\, and my Father is the vinedresser. Every branch of mine that bears no fruit\, he takes away\, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes\, that it may bear more fruit. You are already made clean by the word which I have spoken to you. Abide in me\, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself\, unless it abides in the vine\, neither can you\, unless you abide in me. I am the vine\, you are the branches. He who abides in me\, and I in him\, he it is that bears much fruit\, for apart from me you can do nothing. If a man does not abide in me\, he is cast forth as a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered\, thrown into the fire and burned. If you abide in me\, and my words abide in you\, ask whatever you will\, and it shall be done for you.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Lucillian of Byzantium\, 4 martyred Youths and Paula the Virgin
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 06/03/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Lucillian of Byzantium\, 4 martyred Youths and Paula the Virgin; Athanasios the Wonderworker; Kevin\, Abbot of Glendalough\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 21:26-32\nIN THOSE DAYS\, Paul took the men\, and the next day he purified himself with them and went into the temple\, to give notice when the days of purification would be fulfilled and the offering presented for every one of them. When the seven days were almost completed\, the Jews from Asia\, who had seen him in the temple\, stirred up all the crowd\, and laid hands on him\, crying out\, \"Men of Israel\, help! This is the man who is teaching men everywhere against the people and the law and this place; moreover he also brought Greeks into the temple\, and he has defiled this holy place.\" For they had previously seen Trophimos the Ephesian with him in the city\, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple. Then all the city was aroused\, and the people ran together; they seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple\, and at once the gates were shut. And as they were trying to kill him\, word came to the tribune of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion. He at once took soldiers and centurions\, and ran down to them; and when they saw the tribune and the soldiers\, they stopped beating Paul.\n\nGospel Reading: John 16:2-13\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"The hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God. And they will do this because they have not known the Father\, nor me. But I have said these things to you\, that when their hour comes you may remember that I told you of them.\n\n\"I did not say these things to you from the beginning\, because I was with you. But now I am going to him who sent me; yet none of you asks me\, 'Where are you going?' But because I have said these things to you\, sorrow has filled your hearts. Nevertheless I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away\, for if I do not go away\, the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go\, I will send him to you. And when he comes\, he will convince the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment: concerning sin\, because they do not believe in me; concerning righteousness\, because I go to the Father\, and you will see me no more; concerning judgment\, because the ruler of this world is judged.\n\n\"I have yet many things to say to you\, but you cannot bear them now. When the Spirit of truth comes\, he will guide you into all the truth.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Our Father Metrophanes\, Archbishop of Constantinople
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 06/04/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Our Father Metrophanes\, Archbishop of Constantinople; Mary & Martha\, the sisters of Lazarus; Sophia of Thrace\, The Mother of Orphans; Petroc\, Abbot of Padstow\n\nFast Day (Wine and Oil Allowed)\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 7:26-28;8:1-2\nBrethren\, it was fitting that we should have such a high priest\, holy\, blameless\, unstained\, separated from sinners\, exalted above the heavens.  He has no need\, like those high priests\, to offer sacrifices daily\, first for his own sins and then for those of the people; he did this once for all when he offered up himself.  Indeed\, the law appoints men in their weakness as high priests\, but the word of the oath\, which came later than the law\, appoints a Son who has been made perfect for ever.  Now the point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest\, one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven\, a minister in the sanctuary and the true tent which is set up not by man but by the Lord. \n\nGospel Reading: John 10:1-9\nThe Lord said to the Jews who had come to him\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way\, that man is a thief and a robber; but he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the gatekeeper opens; the sheep hear his voice\, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own\, he goes before them\, and the sheep follow him\, for they know his voice. A stranger they will not follow\, but they will flee from him\, for they do not know the voice of strangers.\" This figure Jesus used with them\, but they did not understand what he was saying to them. So Jesus again said to them\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, I am the door of the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not heed them. I am the door; if any one enters by me\, he will be saved\, and will go in and out and find pasture.\"\n\n

And as they stayed there many days\, Festus laid Paul's case before the king\, saying\, \"There is a man left prisoner by Felix; and when I was at Jerusalem\, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews gave information about him\, asking for sentence against him. I answered them that it was not the custom of the Romans to give up any one before the accused met the accusers face to face\, and had opportunity to make his defense concerning the charge laid against him. When therefore they came together here\, I made no delay\, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought in. When the accusers stood up\, they brought no charge in his case of such evils as I supposed; but they had certain points of dispute with him about their own superstition and about one Jesus\, who was dead\, but whom Paul asserted to be alive.\"\n\nGospel Reading: John 16:23-33\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, if you ask anything of the Father\, he will give it to you in my name. Hitherto you have asked nothing in my name; ask\, and you will receive\, that your joy may be full.\n\n\"I have said this to you in figures; the hour is coming when I shall no longer speak to you in figures but tell you plainly of the Father. In that day you will ask in my name; and I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father for you; for the Father himself loves you\, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from the Father. I came from the Father and have come into the world; again\, I am leaving the world and going to the Father.\"\n\nHis disciples said\, \"Ah\, now you are speaking plainly\, not in any figure! Now we know that you know all things\, and need none to question you; by this we believe that you came from God.\" Jesus answered them\, \"Do you now believe? The hour is coming\, indeed it has come\, when you will be scattered\, every man to his home\, and will leave me alone; yet I am not alone\, for the Father is with me. I have said this to you\, that in me you may have peace.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:The Apodosis of the Feast of the Holy Ascension
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 06/06/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: The Apodosis of the Feast of the Holy Ascension; Hilarion the New of Dalmation Monastery; Bessarion the Wonderworker of Egypt; 5 Virgins of Caesarea:  Martha\, Mary\, Cyris\, Valeria & Marcia\n\nFast Day (Wine and Oil Allowed)\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 27:1-44;28:1\nIN THOSE DAYS\, when it was decided that we should sail for Italy\, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan Cohort\, named Julius. And embarking in a ship of Adramyttium\, which was about to sail to the ports along the coast of Asia\, we put to sea\, accompanied by Aristarchos\, a Macedonian from Thessalonica. The next day we put in at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul kindly\, and gave him leave to go to his friends and be cared for. And putting to sea from there we sailed under the lee of Cyprus\, because the winds were against us. And when we had sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia\, we came to Myra in Lycia. There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy\, and put us on board. We sailed slowly for a number of days\, and arrived with difficulty off Cnidos\, and as the wind did not allow us to go on\, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone. Coasting along it with difficulty\, we came to a place called Fair Havens\, near which was the city of Lasea.\n\nAs much time had been lost\, and the voyage was already dangerous because the fast had already gone by\, Paul advised them\, saying\, \"Sirs\, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss\, not only of the cargo and the ship\, but also of our lives.\" But the centurion paid more attention to the captain and to the owner of the ship than to what Paul said. And because the harbor was not suitable to winter in\, the majority advised to put to sea from there\, on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix\, a harbor of Crete\, looking northeast and southeast\, and winter there.\n\nAnd when the south wind blew gently\, supposing that they had obtained their purpose\, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete\, close inshore. But soon a tempestuous wind\, called the northeaster\, struck down from the land; and when the ship was caught and could not face the wind\, we gave way to it and were driven. And running under the lee of a small island called Cauda\, we managed with difficulty to secure the boat; after hoisting it up\, they took measures to undergird the ship; then\, fearing that they should run on the Syrtis\, they lowered the gear\, and so were driven. As we were violently storm-tossed\, they began next day to throw cargo overboard; and the third day they cast with their own hands the tackle of the ship. And when neither sun nor stars appeared for many a day\, and no small tempest lay on us\, all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned.\n\nAs they had been long without food\, Paul then came forward among them and said\, \"Men\, you should have listened to me\, and should not have set sail from Crete and incurred this injury and loss. I now bid you take heart; for there will be no loss of life among you\, but only of the ship. For this very night there stood by me an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I worship\, and he said\, 'Do not be afraid\, Paul; you must stand before Caesar; and lo\, God has granted you all those who sail with you.' So take heart\, men\, for I have faith in God that it will be exactly as I have been told. But we shall have to run on some island.\"\n\nWhen the fourteenth night had come\, as we were drifting across the sea of Adria\, about midnight the sailors suspected that they were nearing land. So they sounded and found twenty fathoms; a little farther on they sounded again and found fifteen fathoms. And fearing that we might run on the rocks\, they let out four anchors from the stern\, and prayed for the day to come. And as the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship\, and had lowered the boat into the sea\, under pretense of laying out anchors from the bow\, Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers\, 'Unless these men stay in the ship\, you cannot be saved.\" Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat\, and let it go.\n\nAs day was about to dawn\, Paul urged them all to take some food\, saying\, \"Today is the fourteenth day that you have continued in suspense and without food\, having taken nothing. Therefore I urge you to take some food; it will give you strength\, since not a hair is to perish from the head of any of you.\" And when he had said this\, he took bread\, and giving thanks to God in the presence of all he broke it and began to eat. Then they all were encouraged and ate some food themselves. (We were in all two hundred and seventy-six persons in the ship.) And when they had eaten enough\, they lightened the ship\, throwing out the wheat into the sea.\n\nNow when it was day\, they did not recognize the land\, but they noticed a bay with a beach\, on which they planned if possible to bring the ship ashore. So they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea\, at the same time loosening the ropes that tied the rudders; then hoisting the foresail to the wind they made for the beach. But striking a shoal they ran the vessel aground; the bow stuck and remained immovable\, and the stern was broken up by the surf. The soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners\, lest any should swim away and escape; but the centurion\, wishing to save Paul\, kept them from carrying out their purpose. He ordered those who could swim to throw themselves overboard first and make for the land\, and the rest on planks or on pieces of the ship. And so it was that all escaped to land.\n\nAfter we had escaped\, we then learned that the island was called Malta. \n\nGospel Reading: John 17:18-26\nAt that time\, Jesus lifted up his eyes to heaven and said\, \"As you\, Father\, did send me into the world\, so I have sent them into the world. And for their sake I consecrate myself\, that they also may be consecrated in truth.\n\n\"I do not pray for these only\, but also for those who believe in me through their word\, that they may all be one; even as you\, Father\, are in me\, and I in you\, that they also may be in us\, so that the world may believe that you have sent me. The glory which you have given me I have given to them\, that they may be one even as we are one\, I in them and you in me\, that they may become perfectly one\, so that the world may know that you have sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me. Father\, I desire that they also\, whom you have given me\, may be with me where I am\, to behold my glory which you have given me in your love for me before the foundation of the world. O righteous Father\, the world has not known you\, but I have known you; and these know that you have sent me. I made known to them your name\, and I will make it known\, that the love with which you have loved me may be in them\, and I in them.\"\n\n

For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again\, even so\, through Jesus\, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep.  For this we declare to you by the word of the Lord\, that we who are alive\, who are left until the coming of the Lord\, shall not precede those who have fallen asleep.  For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command\, with the archangel's call\, and with the sound of the trumpet of God.  And the dead in Christ will rise first; then we who are alive\, who are left\, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so we shall always be with the Lord.\n\nGospel Reading: John 21:14-25\nAt that time\, Jesus revealed himself to the disciples after he was raised from the dead. And he said to Simon Peter\, \"Simon\, son of John\, do you love me more than these?\" He said to him\, \"Yes\, Lord; you know that I love you.\" He said to him\, \"Feed my lambs.\" A second time he said to him\, \"Simon\, son of John\, do you love me?\" He said to him\, \"Yes\, Lord; you know that I love you.\" He said to him\, \"Tend my sheep.\" He said to him the third time\, \"Simon\, son of John\, do you love me?\" Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time\, \"Do you love me?\" And he said to him\, \"Lord\, you know everything; you know that I love you.\" Jesus said to him\, \"Feed my sheep. Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, when you were young\, you girded yourself and walked where you would; but when you are old\, you will stretch out your hands\, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go.\" (This he said to show by what death he was to glorify God.) And after this he said to him\, \"Follow me.\" Peter turned and saw following them the disciple whom Jesus loved\, who had lain close to his breast at the supper and had said\, \"Lord\, who is it that is going to betray you?\" When Peter saw him\, he said to Jesus\, \"Lord\, what about this man?\" Jesus said to him\, \"If it is my will that he remain until I come\, what is that to you? Follow me!\" The saying spread abroad among the brethren that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die\, but\, \"If it is my will that he remain until I come\, what is that to you?\" This is the disciple who is bearing witness to these things\, and who has written these things; and we know that his testimony is true. But there are also many other things which Jesus did; were every one of them to be written\, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen.\n\n

Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again\, \"Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me\, even so I send you.\" And when he had said this\, he breathed on them\, and said to them\, \"Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any\, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any\, they are retained.\"\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 2:1-11\nWHEN THE DAY of Pentecost had come\, they were all together in one place. And suddenly a sound came from heaven like the rush of a mighty wind\, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared to them tongues as of fire\, distributed and resting on each one of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues\, as the Spirit gave them utterance. Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews\, devout men from every nation under heaven. And at this sound the multitude came together\, and they were bewildered\, because each one heard them speaking in his own language. And they were amazed and wondered\, saying\, \"Are not all these who are speaking Galileans? And how is it that we hear\, each of us in his own native language? Parthians and Medes and Elamites and residents of Mesopotamia\, Judea and Cappadocia\, Pontos and Asia\, Phrygia and Pamphylia\, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene\, and visitors from Rome\, both Jews and proselytes\, Cretans and Arabians\, we hear them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God.\" \n\nGospel Reading: John 7:37-52; 8:12\nOn the last day of the feast\, the great day\, Jesus stood up and proclaimed\, \"If any one thirst\, let him come to me and drink. He who believes in me\, as the scripture has said\, 'Out of his heart shall flow rivers of living water.'\" Now this he said about the Spirit\, which those who believed in him were to receive; for as yet the Spirit had not been given\, because Jesus was not yet glorified.\n\nWhen they heard these words\, some of the people said\, \"This is really the prophet.\" Others said\, \"This is the Christ.\" But some said\, \"Is the Christ to come from Galilee? Has not the scripture said that the Christ is descended from David\, and comes from Bethlehem\, the village where David was?\" So there was a division among the people over him. Some of them wanted to arrest him\, but no one laid hands on him.\n\nThe officers then went back to the chief priests and Pharisees\, who said to them\, \"Why did you not bring him?\" The officers answered\, \"No man ever spoke like this man!\" The Pharisees answered them\, \"Are you led astray\, you also? Have any of the authorities or of the Pharisees believed in him? But this crowd\, who do not know the law\, are accursed.\" Nikodemos\, who had gone to him before\, and who was one of them\, said to them\, \"Does our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he does?\" They replied\, \"Are you from Galilee too? Search and you will see that no prophet is to rise from Galilee.\" Again Jesus spoke to them\, saying\, \"I am the light of the world; he who follows me will not walk in darkness\, but will have the light of life.\"\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 06/09/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Monday of the Holy Spirit; Cyril\, Patriarch of Alexandria; 3 Virgin-martyrs of Chios; 5 Nuns beheaded in Persia:  Thecla\, Mariamne\, Martha\, Mary\, & Enmatha; Righteous Father Columba of Iona; Righteous Father Cyril of Belozersk\n\nFast Free\n\nEpistle Reading: Ephesians 5:8-19\nBrethren\, walk as children of light (for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true)\, and try to learn what is pleasing to the Lord. Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness\, but instead expose them. For it is a shame even to speak of the things that they do in secret; but when anything is exposed by the light it becomes visible\, for anything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it is said\, \"Awake\, O sleeper\, and arise from the dead\, and Christ shall give you light.\" Look carefully then how you walk\, not as unwise men but as wise\, making the most of the time\, because the days are evil. Therefore do not be foolish\, but understand what the will of the Lord is. And do not get drunk with wine\, for that is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit\, addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs\, singing and making melody to the Lord with all your heart.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 18:10-20\nThe Lord said\, \"See that you do not despise one of these little ones; for I tell you that in heaven their angels always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven. For the Son of man came to save the lost. What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep\, and one of them has gone astray\, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go in search of the one that went astray? And if he finds it\, truly\, I say to you\, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray. So it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.\n\n\"If your brother sins against you\, go and tell him his fault\, between you and him alone. If he listens to you\, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen\, take one or two others along with you\, that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them\, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church\, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. Truly\, I say to you\, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven\, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Again I say to you\, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask\, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven\, for where two or three are gathered in my name\, there am I in the midst of them.\"\n\n

I want you to know\, brethren\, that I have often intended to come to you (but thus far have been prevented)\, in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles. I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians\, both to the wise and to the foolish: so I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome. For I am not ashamed of the gospel: it is the power of God for salvation to every one who has faith\, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed through faith for faith; as it is written\, \"The righteous shall live by faith.\"\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 4:23-25;5:1-13\nAt that time\, Jesus went about all Galilee\, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every infirmity among the people. So his fame spread throughout all Syria\, and they brought him all the sick\, those afflicted with various diseases and pains\, demoniacs\, epileptics\, and paralytics\, and he healed them. And great crowds followed him from Galilee and the Dekapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and from beyond the Jordan.\n\nSeeing the crowds\, he went up on the mountain\, and when he sat down his disciples came to him. And he opened his mouth and taught them\, saying:\n\n\"Blessed are the poor in spirit\, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n\n\"Blessed are those who mourn\, for they shall be comforted.\n\n\"Blessed are the meek\, for they shall inherit the earth.\n\n\"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness\, for they shall be satisfied.\n\n\"Blessed are the merciful\, for they shall obtain mercy.\n\n\"Blessed are the pure in heart\, for they shall see God.\n\n\"Blessed are the peacemakers\, for they shall be called sons of God.\n\n\"Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake\, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n\n\"Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad\, for your reward is great in heaven\, for so men persecuted the prophets who were before you.\n\n\"You are the salt of the earth; but if salt has lost its taste\, how shall its saltness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trodden under foot by men.\"\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 06/11/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Bartholomew the Holy Apostle; Barnabas the Holy Apostle; Revelation of the Hymn Axion Estin to a monk on Mt. Athos by the Archangel Gabriel; Luke of Simferopol\n\nFast Free\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Luke 10:16-21\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"He who hears you hears me\, and he who rejects you rejects me\, and he who rejects me rejects him who sent me.\" The seventy returned with joy\, saying\, \"Lord\, even the demons are subject to us in your name!\" And he said to them\, \"I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. Behold\, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions\, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall hurt you. Nevertheless do not rejoice in this\, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.\" In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said\, \"I thank you\, Father\, Lord of heaven and earth\, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes; yes\, Father\, for such was your gracious will.\"\n\nEpistle Reading: I Corinthians 4:9-16\nBrethren\, God has exhibited us apostles as last of all\, like men sentenced to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world\, to angels and to men. We are fools for Christ's sake\, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak\, but you are strong. You are held in honor\, but we in disrepute. To the present hour we hunger and thirst\, we are ill-clad and buffeted and homeless\, and we labor\, working with our own hands. When reviled\, we bless; when persecuted\, we endure; when slandered\, we try to conciliate; we have become\, and are now\, as the refuse of the world\, the off-scouring of all things. I do not write this to make you ashamed\, but to admonish you as my beloved children. For though you have countless guides in Christ\, you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel. I urge you\, then\, be imitators of me.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 5:14-19\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"You are the light of the world.  A city set on a hill cannot be hid.  Nor do men light a lamp and put it under a bushel\, but on a stand\, and it gives light to all in the house.  Let your light so shine before men\, that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.  Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfill them.  For truly\, I say to you\, till heaven and earth pass away\, not an iota\, not a dot\, will pass from the law until all is accomplished.  Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so\, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:1st Thursday after Pentecost
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 06/12/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: 1st Thursday after Pentecost; Onuphrius of Egypt; Peter the Athonite; Holy Martyr Antonine; John the Soldier of Egypt\n\nFast Free\n\nEpistle Reading: Romans 1:28-32;2:1-9\nBrethren\, since the ungodly did not see fit to acknowledge God\, God gave them up to a base mind and to improper conduct. They were filled with all manner of wickedness\, evil\, covetousness\, malice. Full of envy\, murder\, strife\, deceit\, malignity\, they are gossips\, slanderers\, haters of God\, insolent\, haughty\, boastful\, inventors of evil\, disobedient to parents\, foolish\, faithless\, heartless\, ruthless. Though they know God's decree that those who do such things deserve to die\, they not only do them but approve those who practice them. Therefore you have no excuse\, O man\, whoever you are\, when you judge another; for in passing judgment upon him you condemn yourself\, because you\, the judge\, are doing the very same things. We know that the judgment of God rightly falls upon those who do such things. Do you suppose\, O man\, that when you judge those who do such things and yet do them yourself\, you will escape the judgment of God? Or do you presume upon the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience? Do you not know that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance? But by your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed. For he will render to every man according to his works; to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality\, he will give eternal life; but for those who are factious and do not obey the truth\, but obey wickedness\, there will be wrath and fury. There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil\, the Jew first and also the Greek.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 5:27-32\nThe Lord said\, \"You have heard that it was said\, 'You shall not commit adultery.' But I say to you that every one who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin\, pluck it out and throw it away; it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into Gehenna. And if your right hand causes you to sin\, cut it off and throw it away; it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into Gehenna. It was also said\, 'Whoever divorces his wife\, let him give her a certificate of divorce.' But I say to you that every one who divorces his wife\, except on the ground of unchastity\, makes her an adulteress; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:1st Friday after Pentecost
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 06/13/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: 1st Friday after Pentecost; Aquilina the Martyr of Syria; Triphyllos the Bishop of Nicosia\n\nFast Free\n\nEpistle Reading: Romans 2:14-28\nBrethren\, when Gentiles who have not the law do by nature what the law requires\, they are a law to themselves\, even though they do not have the law. They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts\, while their conscience also bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or perhaps excuse them on that day when\, according to my gospel\, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus. But if you call yourself a Jew and rely upon the law and boast of your relation to God and know his will and approve what is excellent\, because you are instructed in the law\, and if you are sure that you are a guide to the blind\, a light to those who are in darkness\, a corrector of the foolish\, a teacher of children\, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth - you then who teach others\, will you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing\, do you steal? You who say that one must not commit adultery\, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols\, do you rob temples? You who boast in the law\, do you dishonor God by breaking the law? For\, as it is written\, \"The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.\" Circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law; but if you break the law\, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision. So\, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law\, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision? Then those who are physically uncircumcised but keep the law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the law. For he is not a real Jew who is one outwardly\, nor is true circumcision something external and physical.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 5:33-41\nThe Lord said\, \"You have heard that it was said to the men of old\, 'You shall not swear falsely\, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.' But I say to you\, Do not swear at all\, either by heaven\, for it is the throne of God\, or by the earth\, for it is his footstool\, or by Jerusalem\, for it is the city of the great King. And do not swear by your head\, for you cannot make one hair white or black. Let what you say be simply 'Yes' or 'No'; anything more than this comes from evil. You have heard that it was said\, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' But I say to you\, Do not resist one who is evil. But if any one strikes you on the right cheek\, turn to him the other also; and if any one would sue you and take your coat\, let him have your cloak as well; and if any one forces you to go one mile\, go with him two miles.\"\n\n

First\, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you\, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world. For God is my witness\, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son\, that without ceasing I mention you always in my prayers\, asking that somehow by God's will I may now at last succeed in coming to you. For I long to see you\, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you\, that is\, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith\, both yours and mine.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 5:42-48\nThe Lord said\, \"Give to him who begs from you\, and do not refuse him who would borrow from you. You have heard that it was said\, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I say to you\, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you\, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good\, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those who love you\, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you salute only your brethren\, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? You\, therefore\, must be perfect\, as your heavenly Father is perfect.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:The Sunday of All Saints
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 06/15/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: The Sunday of All Saints; Amos the Prophet; Our Righteous Father Hieronymus; Augustine the Blessed\, Bishop of Hippo; Jerome the Righteous; Achikos\, Stephanas\, & Fortuanatos the Apostles; Father among the Saints Jonas\, Metropolitan of Kiev; Lazar of Serbia\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Matthew 28:16-20\nAt that time\, the eleven disciples went to Galilee\, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them. And when they saw Him they worshiped Him; but some doubted. And Jesus came and said to them\, \"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations\, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit\, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo\, I am with you always\, to the close of the age. Amen.\"\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 11:33-40;12:1-2\nBrethren\, all the saints through faith conquered kingdoms\, enforced justice\, received promises\, stopped the mouths of lions\, quenched raging fire\, escaped the edge of the sword\, won strength out of weakness\, became mighty in war\, put foreign armies to flight. Women received their dead by resurrection. Some were tortured\, refusing to accept release\, that they might rise again to a better life. Others suffered mocking and scourging\, and even chains and imprisonment. They were stoned\, they were sawn in two\, they were tempted\, they were killed with the sword; they went about in skins of sheep and goats\, destitute\, afflicted\, ill-treated - of whom the world was not worthy - wandering         over deserts and mountains and in dens and caves of the earth. And all these\, though well attested by their faith\, did not receive what was promised\, since God had foreseen something better for us\, that apart from us they should not be made perfect. Therefore\, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses\, let us also lay aside every weight\, and sin which clings so closely\, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us\, looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 10:32-33; 37-38; 19:27-30\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"Every one who acknowledges me before men\, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven; but whoever denies me before men\, I also will deny him before my Father who is in heaven.  He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; and he who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.\"  Then Peter said in reply\, \"Lo\, we have left everything and followed you.  What then shall we have?\"  Jesus said to them\, \"Truly\, I say to you\, in the new world\, when the Son of man shall sit on his glorious throne\, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones\, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.  And every one who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands\, for my name's sake\, will receive a hundredfold\, and inherit eternal life.  But many that are first will be last\, and the last first.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Tychon the Wonderworker
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 06/16/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Tychon the Wonderworker; 40 Martyrs of Rome; Mark the Just of Apollonia\n\nFast Day (Fish Allowed)\n\nEpistle Reading: Romans 2:28-29;3:1-18\nBrethren\, he is not a real Jew who is one outwardly\, nor is true circumcision something external and physical. He is a Jew who is one inwardly\, and real circumcision is a matter of the heart\, spiritual and not literal. His praise is not from men but from God. Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision? Much in every way. To begin with\, the Jews are entrusted with the oracles of God. What if some were unfaithful? Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God? By no means! Let God be true though every man be false\, as it is written\, \"That thou mayest be justified in thy words\, and prevail when thou art judged.\" But if our wickedness serves to show the justice of God\, what shall we say? That God is unjust to inflict wrath on us? (I speak in a human way.) By no means! For then how could God judge the world? But if through my falsehood God's truthfulness abounds to his glory\, why am I still being condemned as a sinner? And why not do evil that good may come? - as some people slanderously charge us with saying. Their condemnation is just. What then? Are we Jews any better off? No\, not at all; for we have already charged that all men\, both Jews and Greeks\, are under the power of sin\, as it is written:\n\n\"None is righteous\, no\, not one; no one understands\, no one seeks for God. All have turned aside\, together they have gone wrong; no one does good\, not even one.\"\n\n\"Their throat is an open grave\, they use their tongues to deceive.\"\n\n\"The venom of asps is under their lips.\"\n\n\"Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.\"\n\n\"Their feet are swift to shed blood\, in their paths are ruin and misery\, and the way of peace they do not know.\" \n\n\"There is no fear of God before their eyes.\"\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 6:31-34; 7:9-11\nThe Lord said\, \"Do not be anxious\, saying\, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' For the Gentiles seek all these things; and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness\, and all these things shall be yours as well. Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow\, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Let the day's own trouble be sufficient for the day. Or what man of you\, if his son asks him for bread\, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish\, will give him a serpent? If you then\, who are evil\, know how to give good gifts to your children\, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Isaurus the Holy Martyr & his Companions of Athens
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 06/17/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Isaurus the Holy Martyr & his Companions of Athens; Manuel\, Sabel\, & Ishmael the Martyrs of Persia; Righteous Father Botolph\, Abbot of the Monastery of Ikanhoe\n\nFast Day (Fish Allowed)\n\nEpistle Reading: Romans 4:4-12\nBrethren\, to one who works\, his wages are not reckoned as a gift but as his due. And to one who does not work but trusts him who justifies the ungodly\, his faith is reckoned as righteousness. So also David pronounces a blessing upon the man to whom God reckons righteousness apart from works: \"Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven\, and whose sins are covered; blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not reckon his sin.\" Is this blessing pronounced only upon the circumcised\, or also upon the uncircumcised? We say that faith was reckoned to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it reckoned to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after\, but before he was circumcised. He received circumcision as a sign or seal of the righteousness which he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised and who thus have righteousness reckoned to them\, and likewise the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but also follow the example of the faith which our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 7:15-21\nThe Lord said\, \"Beware of false prophets\, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thorns\, or figs from thistles? So\, every sound tree bears good fruit\, but the bad tree bears evil fruit. A sound tree cannot bear evil fruit\, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus you will know them by their fruits. Not every one who says to me\, 'Lord\, Lord\,' shall enter the kingdom of heaven\, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.\"\n\n

If it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs\, faith is null and the promise is void. For the law brings wrath\, but where there is no law there is no transgression. That is why it depends on faith\, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his descendants -- not only to the adherents of the law but also to those who share the faith of Abraham\, for he is the father of us all\, as it is written\, \"I have made you the father of many nations\" -- in the presence of the God in whom he believed\, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist. In hope he believed against hope\, that he should become the father of many nations; as he had been told\, \"So shall your descendants be.\" He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body\, which was as good as dead because he was about a hundred years old\, or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah's womb. No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God\, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God\, fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised. That is why his faith was \"reckoned to him as righteousness.\" But the words\, \"it was reckoned to him\,\" were written not for his sake alone\, but for ours also. It will be reckoned to us who believe in him that raised from the dead Jesus our Lord\, who was put to death for our trespasses and raised for our justification.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 7:21-23\nThe Lord said\, \"Not every one who says to me\, 'Lord\, Lord\,' shall enter the kingdom of heaven\, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me\, 'Lord\, Lord\, did we not prophesy in your name\, and cast out demons in your name\, and do many mighty works in your name?' And then will I declare to them\, 'I never knew you; depart from me\, you evildoers.'\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Thaddeus (Jude) the Apostle & Brother of Our Lord
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 06/19/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Thaddeus (Jude) the Apostle & Brother of Our Lord; Holy Martyr Zosima; Our Righteous Father Zenonus; Paisius the Great of Egypt\n\nFast Day (Fish Allowed)\n\nEpistle Reading: Jude 1:1-25\nJUDE\, a servant of Jesus Christ\, and brother of James\, To those who are called\, beloved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ: May mercy\, peace\, and love be multiplied to you. Beloved\, being very eager to write to you of our common salvation\, I found it necessary to write appealing to you to contend for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints. For admission has been secretly gained by some who long ago were designated for this condemnation\, ungodly persons who pervert the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny the only Master and our Lord Jesus Christ. Now I desire to remind you\, though you were once for all fully informed\, that the Lord saved a people out of the land of Egypt\, afterward destroyed those who did not believe. And the angels that did not keep their own position but left their proper dwelling have been kept by him in eternal chains in the nether gloom until the judgment of the great day; just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities\, which likewise acted immorally and indulged in unnatural lust\, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire. Yet in like manner these men in their dreamings defile the flesh\, reject authority\, and revile the glorious ones. But when the archangel Michael\, contending with the devil\, disputed about the body of Moses\, he did not presume to pronounce a reviling judgment upon him\, but said\, \"The Lord rebuke you.\" But these men revile whatever they do not understand\, and by those things that they know by instinct as irrational animals\, they are destroyed. Woe to the ungodly\, for they walk in the way of Cain\, and abandon themselves for the sake of gain to Balaam's error\, and perish in Korah's rebellion. These are blemishes on your love feasts\, as they boldly carouse together\, looking after themselves; waterless clouds\, carried along by winds; fruitless trees in late autumn\, twice dead\, uprooted; wild waves of the sea\, casting up the foam of their own shame; wandering stars for whom the nether gloom of darkness has been reserved for ever. It was of these also that Enoch in the seventh generation from Adam prophesied\, saying\, \"Behold\, the Lord came with his holy myriads\, to execute judgment on all\, and to convict all the ungodly of all their deeds of ungodliness which they have committed in such an ungodly way\, and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.\" These are grumblers\, malcontents\, following their own passions\, loud-mouthed boasters\, flattering people to gain advantage. But you must remember\, beloved\, the predictions of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; they said to you\, \"in the last time there will be scoffers\, following their own ungodly passions.\" It is these who set up divisions\, worldly people\, devoid of the Spirit. But you\, beloved\, build yourselves up on your most holy faith; pray in the Holy Spirit; keep yourselves in the love of God; wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. And convince some\, who doubt; save some\, by snatching them out of the fire; on some have mercy with fear\, hating even the garment spotted by the flesh. Now to him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you without blemish before the presence of his glory with rejoicing\, to the only God\, our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord\, be glory\, majesty\, dominion\, and authority\, before all time and now and for ever. Amen. \n\nGospel Reading: John 14:21-24\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"He who has my commandments and keeps them\,  he it is who loves me; and he who loves me will be loved by my Father\,  and I will love him and manifest myself to him.\" Judas (not Iscariot)  said to him\, \"Lord\, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us\, and  not to the world?\" Jesus answered him\, \"If a man loves me\, he will keep  my word\, and my Father will love him\, and we will come to him and make  our home with him. He who does not love me does not keep my words; and  the word which you hear is not mine but the Father's who sent me.\"\n\n

For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners\, so by one man's obedience many will be made righteous. Law came in\, to increase the trespass; but where sin increased\, grace abounded all the more\, so that\, as sin reigned in death\, grace also might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\n\nWhat shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it?\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 9:14-17\nAt that time\, the disciples of John came to Jesus\, saying\, \"Why do we and the Pharisees fast\, but your disciples do not fast?\" And Jesus said to them\, \"Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The days will come\, when the bridegroom is taken away from them\, and then they will fast. And no one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment\, for the patch tears away from the garment\, and a worse tear is made. Neither is new wine put into old wineskins; if it is\, the skins burst\, and the wine is spilled\, and the skins are destroyed; but new wine is put into fresh wineskins\, and so both are preserved.\"\n\n

For no human being will be justified in his sight by works of the law\, since through the law comes knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from law\, although the law and the prophets bear witness to it\, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction; since all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\, they are justified by his grace as a gift\, through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 7:1-8\nThe Lord said\, \"Judge not\, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged\, and the measure you give will be the measure you get. Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye\, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother\, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye\,' when there is the log in your own eye? You hypocrite\, first take the log out of your own eye\, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye. Do not give dogs what is holy; and do not throw your pearls before swine\, lest they trample them under foot and turn to attack you. Ask\, and it will be given you; seek\, and you will find; knock\, and it will be opened to you. For every one who asks receives\, and he who seeks finds\, and to him who knocks it will be opened.\n\n

SUMMARY:2nd Sunday of Matthew
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 06/22/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: 2nd Sunday of Matthew; Eusebius\, Bishop of Samosata; Zenon the Martyr & his servant Zenas of Philadelphia; Anastasia the Serbian; Alban the Protomartyr of Britain\n\nFast Day (Fish Allowed)\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Mark 16:1-8\nWhen the Sabbath was past\, Mary Magdalene\, and Mary the mother of James and Salome\, bought spices\, so that they might go and anoint Jesus. And very early on the first day of the week they went to the tomb when the sun had risen. And they were saying to one another\, \"Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the tomb?\" And looking up\, they saw that the stone was rolled back - it was very large. And entering the tomb\, they saw a young man sitting on the right side\, dressed in a white robe; and they were amazed. And he said to them\, \"Do not be amazed; you seek Jesus of Nazareth\, who was crucified. He has risen\, He is not here; see the place where they laid Him. But go\, tell His disciples and Peter that He is going before you to Galilee; there you will see Him\, as He told you.\" And they went out and fled from the tomb\, for trembling and astonishment had come upon them; and they said nothing to anyone\, for they were afraid.\n\nEpistle Reading: Romans 2:10-16\nBrethren\, glory and honor and peace for every one who does good\, the Jew first and also the Greek.  For God shows no partiality.  All who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law\, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.  For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God\, but the doers of the law who will be justified.  When Gentiles who have not the law do by nature what the law requires\, they are a law to themselves\, even though they do not have the law. They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts\, while their conscience also bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or perhaps excuse them on that day when\, according to my gospel\, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus. \n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 4:18-23\nAt that time\, as Jesus walked by the Sea of Galilee\, he saw two brothers\, Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother\, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. And he said to them\, \"Follow me\, and I will make you fishers of men.\" Immediately they left their nets and followed him. And going on from there he saw two other brothers\, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother\, in the boat with Zebedee their father\, mending their nets\, and he called them. Immediately they left their boat and their father\, and followed him. And he went about all Galilee\, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every infirmity among the people.\n\n

SUMMARY:Agrippina the Martyr of Rome
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 06/23/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Agrippina the Martyr of Rome; Holy Martyrs Aristocleus the Priest\, Demetrius the Deacon and Athanasius the Reader; The Holy New Bishop Martyrs Gerasimus of Crete\, Neophytos of Knossos\, Joachim of Cherronisos\, Hierotheos of Lampi\, Zachariah of Sitia\, Joachim of Petra\, Gerasimos of Rethymno\, Kallinikos of Kydonia\, Melchizedek of Kissamos\, Kallinikos of Diopolos\, and those Martyred with them (1821-1822); Mark\, Bishop of Ephesus; Etheldreda the Queen\n\nFast Day (Fish Allowed)\n\nEpistle Reading: Romans 7:1-14\nBrethren\, I am speaking to those who know the law. Do you not know that the law is binding on a person only during his life? Thus a married woman is bound by law to her husband as long as he lives; but if her husband dies she is discharged from the law concerning the husband. Accordingly\, she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies she is free from that law\, and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress.\n\nLikewise\, my brethren\, you have died to the law through the body of Christ\, so that you may belong to another\, to him who has been raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God. While we were living in the flesh\, our sinful passions\, aroused by the law\, were at work in our members to bear fruit for death. But now we are discharged from the law\, dead to that which held us captive\, so that we serve not under the old written code but in the new life of the Spirit.\n\nWhat then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet\, if it had not been for the law\, I should not have known sin. I should not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said\, \"You shall not covet.\" But sin\, finding opportunity in the commandment\, wrought in me all kinds of covetousness. Apart from the law sin lies dead. I was once alive apart from the law\, but when the commandment came\, sin revived and I died; the very commandment which promised life proved to be death to me. For sin\, finding opportunity in the commandment\, deceived me and by it killed me. So the law is holy\, and the commandment is holy and just and good.\n\nDid that which is good\, then\, bring death to me? By no means! It was sin\, working death in me through what is good\, in order that sin might be shown to be sin\, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 9:36-38; 10:1-8\nAt that time\, when Jesus saw the crowds\, he had compassion for them\, because they were harassed and helpless\, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples\, \"The harvest is plentiful\, but the laborers are few; pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.\"\n\nAnd he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits\, to cast them out\, and to heal every disease and every infirmity. The names of the twelve apostles are these: first\, Simon\, who is called Peter\, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee\, and John his brother; Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaios\, and Lebbaeos called Thaddaios; Simon the Cananaean\, and Judas Iscariot\, who betrayed him. These twelve Jesus sent out\, charging them\, \"Go nowhere among the Gentiles\, and enter no town of the Samaritans\, but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And preach as you go\, saying\, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.' Heal the sick\, raise the dead\, cleanse lepers\, cast out demons. You received without paying\, give without pay.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Nativity of the Forerunner John the Baptist
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 06/24/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Nativity of the Forerunner John the Baptist; Elizabeth\, Mother of the Forerunner; Athanasios Parios; Panagiotis the New Martyr\n\nFast Day (Fish Allowed)\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Luke 1:24-25\, 57-68\, 76\, 80\nAt that time\, Elizabeth\, the wife of Zacharias conceived\, and for five months hid herself\, saying\, \"Thus the Lord has done to me in the days when he looked on me\, to take away my reproach among men.\" Now the time came for Elizabeth to be delivered\, and she gave birth to a son. And her neighbors and kinsfolk heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her\, and they rejoiced with her. And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they would have named him Zacharias after his father\, but his mother said\, \"Not so; he shall be called John.\" And they said to her\, \"None of your kindred is called by this name.\" And they made signs to his father\, inquiring what he would have him called. And he asked for a writing tablet\, and wrote\, \"His name is John.\" And they all marveled. And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed\, and he spoke\, blessing God. And fear came on all their neighbors. And all these things were talked about through all the hill country of Judea; and all who heard them laid them up in their hearts\, saying\, \"What then will this child be?\" For the hand of the Lord was with him. And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit\, and prophesied\, saying\, \"Blessed be the Lord God of Israel\, for he has visited and redeemed his people\, and you\, child\, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways.\" And the child grew and became strong in spirit\, and he was in the wilderness till the day of his manifestation to Israel.\n\nEpistle Reading: Romans 13:11-14;14:1-4\nBrethren\, salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed; the night is far gone\, the day is at hand.  Let us then cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light; let us conduct ourselves becomingly as in the day\, not in reveling and drunkenness\, not in debauchery and licentiousness\, not in quarreling and jealousy.  But put on the Lord Jesus Christ\, and make no provision for the flesh\, to gratify its desires.\n\nAs for the man who is weak in faith\, welcome him\, but not for disputes over opinions.  One believes he may eat anything\, while the weak man eats only vegetables.  Let not him who eats despise him who abstains\, and let not him who abstains pass judgment on him who eats; for God has welcomed him.  Who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another?  It is before his own master that he stands or falls.  And he will be upheld\, for God is able to make him stand. \n\nGospel Reading: Luke 1:1-25\, 57-68\, 76\, 80\nInasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things which have been accomplished among us\, just as they were delivered to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word\, it seemed good to me also\, having followed all things closely for some time past\, to write an orderly account for you\, most excellent Theophilos\, that you may know the truth concerning the things of which you have been informed. In the days of Herod\, king of Judea\, there was a priest named Zacharias\, of the division of Abijah; and he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron\, and her name was Elizabeth. And they were both righteous before God\, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless. But they had no child\, because Elizabeth was barren\, and both were advanced in years. Now while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty\, according to the custom of the priesthood\, it fell to him by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense. And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense. And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. And Zacharias was troubled when he saw him\, and fear fell upon him. But the angel said to him\, \"Do not be afraid\, Zacharias\, for your prayer is heard\, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son\, and you shall call his name John. And you will have joy and gladness\, and many will rejoice at his birth; for he will be great before the Lord\, and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink\, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit\, even from his mother's womb. And he will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God\, and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah\, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children\, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just\, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.\" And Zacharias said to the angel\, \"How shall I know this? For I am an old man\, and my wife is advanced in years.\" And the angel answered him\, \"I am Gabriel\, who stands in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak to you\, and to bring you this good news. And behold\, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things come to pass\, because you did not believe my words\, which will be fulfilled in their time.\" And the people were waiting for Zacharias\, and they wondered at his delay in the temple. And when he came out\, he could not speak to them\, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he made signs to them and remained dumb. And when his time of service was ended\, he went to his home.\n\nAfter these days his wife Elizabeth conceived\, and for five months she hid herself\, saying\, \"Thus the Lord has done to me in the days when he looked on me\, to take away my reproach among men.\" Now the time came for Elizabeth to be delivered\, and she gave birth to a son. And her neighbors and kinsfolk heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her\, and they rejoiced with her. And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they would have named him Zacharias after his father\, but his mother said\, \"Not so; he shall be called John.\" And they said to her\, \"None of your kindred is called by this name.\" And they made signs to his father\, inquiring what he would have him called. And he asked for a writing tablet\, and wrote\, \"His name is John.\" And they all marveled. And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed\, and he spoke\, blessing God. And fear came on all their neighbors. And all these things were talked about through all the hill country of Judea; and all who heard them laid them up in their hearts\, saying\, \"What then will this child be?\" For the hand of the Lord was with him. \n\nAnd his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit\, and prophesied\, saying\, \"Blessed be the Lord God of Israel\, for he has visited and redeemed his people. And you\, child\, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways.\" And the child grew and became strong in spirit\, and he was in the wilderness till the day of his manifestation to Israel.\n\n

SUMMARY:Leavetaking of the Nativity of the Forerunner John the Baptist
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 06/25/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Leavetaking of the Nativity of the Forerunner John the Baptist; The Righteous Martyr Febronia; Methodius of Nevritos; Prokopios the New Martyr; Dionysius & Dometios the Righteous of Mount Athos; Orentios\, Pharmakios\, Eros\, Phirmos\, Phirminos\, Kyriakos\, and Longinos the Martyrs and Brothers\n\nStrict Fast\n\nEpistle Reading: Romans 8:2-13\nBrethren\, the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death. For God has done what the law\, weakened by the flesh\, could not do: sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin\, he condemned sin in the flesh\, in order that the just requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us\, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh\, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. To set the mind on the flesh is death\, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God's law\, indeed it cannot; and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.\n\nBut you are not in the flesh\, you are in the Spirit\, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Any one who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. But if Christ is in you\, although your bodies are dead because of sin\, your spirits are alive because of righteousness. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you\, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit which dwells in you.\n\nSo then\, brethren\, we are debtors\, not to the flesh\, to live according to the flesh-for if you live according to the flesh you will die\, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 10:16-22\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"Behold\, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves; so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. Beware of men; for they will deliver you up to councils\, and flog you in their synagogues\, and you will be dragged before governors and kings for my sake\, to bear testimony before them and the Gentiles. When they deliver you up\, do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say; for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour; for it is not you who speak\, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. Brother will deliver up brother to death\, and the father his child\, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death; and you will be hated by all for my name's sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:David the Righteous of Thessalonika
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 06/26/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: David the Righteous of Thessalonika; Appearance of the Icon of Our Most Holy Lady the Theotokos of Tikhvin\n\nFast Day (Fish Allowed)\n\nEpistle Reading: Romans 8:22-27\nBrethren\, we know that the whole creation has been groaning in travail together until now; and not only the creation\, but we ourselves\, who have the first fruits of the Spirit\, groan inwardly as we wait for adoption as sons\, the redemption of our bodies. For in this hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see\, we wait for it with patience.\n\nLikewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought\, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs too deep for words. And he who searches the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 10:23-31\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"When they persecute you in one town\, flee to the next; for truly\, I say to you\, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of man comes. A disciple is not above his teacher\, nor a servant above his master; it is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher\, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul\, how much more will they malign those of his household. So have no fear of them; for nothing is covered that will not be revealed\, or hidden that will not be known. What I tell you in the dark\, utter in the light; and what you hear whispered\, proclaim upon the housetops. And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father's will. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not\, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Samson the Hospitable
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 06/27/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Samson the Hospitable; Joanna the Myrrhbearer; Anektos the Martyr; Luke the Hermit\n\nStrict Fast\n\nEpistle Reading: Romans 9:6-19\nBrethren\, it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel\, and not all are children of Abraham because they are his descendants; but \"Through Isaac shall your descendants be named.\" This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God\, but the children of the promise are reckoned as descendants. For this is what the promise said\, \"About this time I will return and Sarah shall have a son.\" And not only so\, but also when Rebecca had conceived children by one man\, our forefather Isaac\, though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad\, in order that God's purpose of election might continue\, not because of works but because of his call\, she was told\, \"The elder will serve the younger.\" As it is written\, \"Jacob I loved\, but Esau I hated.\" What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God's part? By no means! For he says to Moses\, \"I will have mercy on whom I have mercy\, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.\" So it depends not upon man's will or exertion\, but upon God's mercy. For the scripture says to Pharoah\, \"I have raised you up for the very purpose of showing my power in you\, so that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth.\" So then he has mercy upon whomever he wills\, and he hardens the heart of whomever he wills. You will say to me then\, \"Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?\"\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 10:32-36; 11:1\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"Every one who acknowledges me before men\, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven; but whoever denies me before men\, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven. Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth; I have not come to bring peace but a sword. For I have come to set a man against his father\, and a daughter against her mother\, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and a man's foes will be those of his own household.\"\n\nAnd when Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples\, he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities.\n\n

Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes\, of Gentiles also\, since God is one; and he will justify the circumcised on the ground of their faith and the uncircumcised through their faith. Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary\, we uphold the law. What then shall we say about Abraham\, our forefather according to the flesh? For if Abraham was justified by works\, he has something to boast about\, but not before God. For what does the scripture say? \"Abraham believed God\, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.\"\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 7:24-29; 8:1-4\nThe Lord said\, \"Every one who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house upon the rock; and the rain fell\, and the floods came\, and the winds blew and beat upon that house\, but it did not fall\, because it had been founded on the rock. And every one who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house upon the sand; and the rain fell\, and the floods came\, and the winds blew and beat against that house\, and it fell; and great was the fall of it.\" And when Jesus finished these sayings\, the crowds were astonished at his teaching\, for he taught them as one who had authority\, and not as their scribes. When he came down from the mountain\, great crowds followed him; and behold\, a leper came to him and knelt before him saying\, \"Lord\, if you will\, you can make me clean.\" And he stretched out his hand and touched him\, saying\, \"I will; be clean.\" And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. And Jesus said to him\, \"See that you say nothing to any one; but go\, show yourself to the priest\, and offer the gift that Moses commanded\, for a proof to them.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Peter and Paul\, the Holy Apostles
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 06/29/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Peter and Paul\, the Holy Apostles\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Mark 16:9-20\nWhen Jesus rose early on the first day of the week\, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene\, from whom He had cast out seven demons. She went and told those who had been with Him\, as they mourned and wept. But when they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her\, they would not believe it.\n\nAfter this he appeared in another form to two of them\, as they were walking into the country. And they went back and told the rest\, but they did not believe them. After this He appeared to the eleven themselves as they sat at table and He upbraided them for their unbelief and hardness of heart\, because they had not believed those who saw Him after He had risen. And He said to them\, \"Go into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation. He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned. And these signs will accompany those who believe: in My name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents\, and if they drink any deadly thing\, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick\, and they will recover.\"\n\nSo then the Lord Jesus\, after He had spoken to them\, was taken up into heaven\, and sat down at the right hand of God. And they went forth and preached everywhere\, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that attended it. Amen.\n\nEpistle Reading: II Corinthians 11:21-33;12:1-9\nBrethren\, whatever anyone dares to boast of -- I am speaking as a fool -- I also dare to boast of that. Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I. Are they servants of Christ? I am a better one -- I am talking like a madman -- with far greater labors\, far more imprisonments\, with countless beatings\, and often near death. Five times I have received at the hands of the Jews the forty lashes less one. Three times I have been beaten with rods; once I was stoned. Three times I have been shipwrecked; a night and a day I have been adrift at sea; on frequent journeys\, in danger from rivers\, danger from robbers\, danger from my own people\, danger from Gentiles\, danger in the city\, danger in the wilderness\, danger at sea\, danger from false brethren; in toil and hardship\, through many a sleepless night\, in hunger and thirst\, often without food\, in cold and exposure. And\, apart from other things\, there is the daily pressure upon me of my anxiety for all the churches. Who is weak\, and I am not weak? Who is made to fall\, and I am not indignant?\n\nIf I must boast\, I will boast of the things that show my weakness. The God and Father of the Lord Jesus\, he who is blessed for ever\, knows that I do not lie. At Damascus\, the governor under King Aretas guarded the city of Damascus in order to seize me\, but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall\, and escaped his hands.\n\nI must boast; there is nothing to be gained by it\, but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven -- whether in the body or out of the body I do not know\, God knows. And I know that this man was caught up into Paradise -- whether in the body or out of the body I do not know\, God knows -- and he heard things that cannot be told\, which man may not utter. On behalf of this man I will boast\, but on my own behalf I will not boast\, except of my weaknesses. Though if I wish to boast\, I shall not be a fool\, for I shall be speaking the truth. But I refrain from it\, so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me. And to keep me from being too elated by the abundance of revelations\, a thorn was given me in the flesh\, a messenger of Satan\, to harass me\, to keep me from being too elated. Three times I besought the Lord about this\, that it should leave me; but he said to me\, \"My grace is sufficient for you\, for my power is made perfect in weakness.\" I will all the more gladly boast of my weaknesses\, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 16:13-19\nAt that time\, when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi\, he asked his disciples\, \"Who do men say that the Son of man is?\" And they said\, \"Some say John the Baptist\, others say Elijah\, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.\" He said to them\, \"But who do you say that I am?\" Simon Peter replied\, \"You are the Christ\, the Son of the living God.\" And Jesus answered him\, \"Blessed are you\, Simon Bar Jona! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you\, but my Father who is in heaven. And I tell you\, you are Peter\, and on this rock I will build my church\, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven\, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven\, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\"\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 06/30/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Synaxis of the Twelve Holy Apostles; Michael the New Martyr of Athens\n\nEpistle Reading: I Corinthians 4:9-16\nBrethren\, God has exhibited us apostles as last of all\, like men sentenced to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world\, to angels and to men. We are fools for Christ's sake\, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak\, but you are strong. You are held in honor\, but we in disrepute. To the present hour we hunger and thirst\, we are ill-clad and buffeted and homeless\, and we labor\, working with our own hands. When reviled\, we bless; when persecuted\, we endure; when slandered\, we try to conciliate; we have become\, and are now\, as the refuse of the world\, the off-scouring of all things. I do not write this to make you ashamed\, but to admonish you as my beloved children. For though you have countless guides in Christ\, you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel. I urge you\, then\, be imitators of me.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 9:36\, 10:1-8\nAt that time\, when Jesus saw the crowds\, he had compassion for them\, because they were harassed and helpless\, like sheep without a shepherd. And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits\, to cast them out\, and to heal every disease and every infirmity. The names of the twelve apostles are these: first\, Simon\, who is called Peter\, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee\, and John his brother; Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaios\, and Thaddaios; Simon the Cananaean. and Judas Iscariot\, who betrayed him. These twelve Jesus sent out\, charging them\, \"Go nowhere among the Gentiles\, and enter no town of the Samaritans\, but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And preach as you go\, saying\, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.' Heal the sick\, raise the dead\, cleanse lepers\, cast out demons. You received without paying\, give without pay.\"\n\n

And God has appointed in the church first apostles\, second prophets\, third teachers\, then workers of miracles\, then healers\, helpers\, administrators\, speakers in various kinds of tongues.  Are all apostles?  Are all prophets?  Are all teachers?  Do all work miracles?  Do all possess gifts of healing?  Do all speak with tongues?  Do all interpret?  But earnestly desire the higher gifts.  And I will show you a still more excellent way.  If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels\, but have not love\, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.  And if I have prophetic powers\, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge\, and if I have all faith\, so as to remove mountains\, but have not love\, I am nothing.  If I give away all I have\, and if I deliver my body to be burned\, but have not love\, I gain nothing. Love is patient and kind; love is not jealous or boastful; it is not arrogant or rude. Love does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrong\, but rejoices in the right. Love bears all things\, believes all things\, hopes all things\, endures all things. Love never ends.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 10:1\, 5-8\nAt that time\, Jesus called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits\, to cast them out\, and to heal every disease and every infirmity.

For a tent was prepared\, the outer one\, in which were the lampstand and the table and the bread of the Presence; it is called the Holy Place. Behind the second curtain stood a tent called the Holy of Holies\, having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold\, which contained a golden urn holding the manna\, and Aaron's rod that budded\, and the tables of the covenant; above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail. These preparations having thus been made\, the priests go continually into the outer tent\, performing their ritual duties; but into the second only the high priest goes\, and he but once a year\, and not without taking blood which he offers for himself and for the errors of the people.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 1:39-49\, 56\nIn those days\, Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country\, to a city of Judah\, and she entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth. And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary\, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and she exclaimed with a loud cry\, \"Blessed are you among women\, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why is this granted me\, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold\, when the voice of your greeting came to my ears\, the babe in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.\"\n\n  And Mary said\, \"My soul magnifies the Lord\, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior\, for he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden. For behold\, henceforth all generations will call me blessed; for he who is mighty has done great things for me\, and holy is his name.\" And Mary remained with her about three months\, and returned to her home.\n\n

Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles\, I magnify my ministry in order to make my fellow Jews jealous\, and thus save some of them. For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world\, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead? If the dough offered as first fruits is holy\, so is the whole lump; and if the root is holy\, so are the branches. But if some of the branches were broken off\, and you\, a wild olive shoot\, were grafted in their place to share the richness of the olive tree\, do not boast over the branches. If you do boast\, remember it is not you that support the root\, but the root that supports you. You will say\, \"Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.\" That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief\, but you stand fast only through faith. So do not become proud\, but stand in awe. For if God did not spare the natural branches\, neither will he spare you. Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen\, but God's kindness to you\, provided you continue in his kindness; otherwise you too will be cut off. And even the others\, if they do not persist in their unbelief\, will be grafted in\, for God has the power to graft them in again. For if you have been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree\, and grafted\, contrary to nature\, into a cultivated olive tree\, how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 11:27-30\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"All things have been delivered to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father\, and no one knows the Father except the Son and any one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.  Come to me\, all who labor and are heavy laden\, and I will give you rest.  Take my yoke upon you\, and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart\, and you will find rest for your souls.  For my yoke is easy\, and my burden is light.\"\n\n

For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable. Just as you were once disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience\, so they have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may receive mercy. For God has consigned all men to disobedience\, that he may have mercy upon all. O the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways! \"For who has known the mind of the Lord\, or who has been his counselor?\" \"Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid?\" For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory for ever. Amen.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 12:1-8\nAt that time\, Jesus went through the grain fields on the sabbath; his disciples were hungry\, and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat. But when the Pharisees saw it\, they said to him\, \"Look\, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the sabbath.\" He said to them\, \"Have you not read what David did\, when he was hungry\, and those who were with him: how he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence\, which it was not lawful for him to eat nor for those who were with him\, but only for the priests? Or have you not read in the law how on the sabbath the priests in the temple profane the sabbath\, and are guiltless? I tell you\, something greater than the temple is here. And if you had known what this means\, 'I desire mercy\, and not sacrifice\,' you would not have condemned the guiltless. For the Son of man is lord of the sabbath.\"\n\n

And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb\, but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. While they were perplexed about this\, behold\, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel; and as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground\, the men said to them\, \"Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here\, but has risen. Remember how He told you\, while He was still in Galilee\, that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men\, and be crucified\, and on the third day rise.\" And they remembered His words and returning from the tomb they told all this to the eleven and to all the rest. Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told this to the Apostles; but these words seemed to them an idle tale\, and they did not believe them. But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in\, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home wondering at what had happened.\n\nEpistle Reading: Romans 6:18-23\nBrethren\, having been set free from sin\, you have become slaves of righteousness. I am speaking in human terms\, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once yielded your members to impurity and to greater and greater iniquity\, so now yield your members to righteousness for sanctification.\n\nWhen you were slaves of sin\, you were free in regard to righteousness. But then what return did you get from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death. But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God\, the return you get is sanctification and its end\, eternal life. For the wages of sin is death\, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 8:5-13\nAt that time\, as Jesus entered Capernaum\, a centurion came forward to him\, beseeching him and saying\, \"Lord\, my servant is lying paralyzed at home\, in terrible distress.\" And he said to him\, \"I will come and heal him.\" But the centurion answered him\, \"Lord\, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof; but only say the word\, and my servant will be healed. For I am a man under authority\, with soldiers under me; and I say to one\, 'Go\,' and he goes\, and to another\, 'Come\,' and he comes\, and to my slave\, 'Do this\,' and he does it.\" When Jesus heard him\, he marveled\, and said to those who followed him\, \"Truly\, I say to you\, not even in Israel have I found such faith. I tell you\, many will come from east and west and sit at table with Abraham\, Isaac\, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven\, while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.\" And to the centurion Jesus said\, \"Go; be it done for you as you have believed.\" And the servant was healed at that very moment.\n\n

So that the law was our custodian until Christ came\, that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come\, we are no longer under a custodian; for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God\, through faith. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek\, there is neither slave nor free\, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you are Christ's\, then you are Abraham's offspring\, heirs according to promise. I mean that the heir\, as long as he is a child\, is no better than a slave\, though he is the owner of all the estate; but he is under guardians and trustees until the date set by the father. So with us; when we were children\, we were slaves to the elemental spirits of the universe. But when the time had fully come\, God sent forth his Son\, born of a woman\, born under the law\, to redeem those who were under the law\, so that we might receive adoption as sons.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 5:24-34\nAt that time\, a great crowd followed Jesus and thronged about him. And there was a woman who had had a flow of blood for twelve years\, and who had suffered much under many physicians\, and had spent all that she had\, and was no better but rather grew worse. She had heard the reports about Jesus\, and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment. For she said\, \"If I touch even his garments\, I shall be made well.\" And immediately the hemorrhage ceased; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. And Jesus\, perceiving in himself that power had gone forth from him\, immediately turned about in the crowd\, and said\, \"Who touched my garments?\" And his disciples said to him\, \"You see the crowd pressing around you\, and yet you say\, 'Who touched me?'\" And he looked around to see who had done it. But the woman\, knowing what had been done to her\, came in fear and trembling and fell down before him\, and told him the whole truth. And he said to her\, \"Daughter\, your faith has made you well; go in peace\, and be healed of your disease.\"\n\n

For to this end we toil and suffer reproach\, because we have our hope set on the living God\, who is the Savior of all men\, especially of those who believe. Command and teach these things. Let no one despise your youth\, but set the believers an example in speech and conduct\, in love\, in faith\, in purity. Till I come\, attend to the public reading of scripture\, to preaching\, to teaching. Do not neglect the gift you have\, which was given you by prophetic utterance when the council of elders laid their hands upon you. Practice these duties\, devote yourself to them\, so that all may see your progress.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 6:17-19\, 9:1-2\, 10:16-21\nAt that time\, a crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people came to Jesus from all Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon\, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured. And all the crowd sought to touch him\, for power came forth from him and healed them all. And he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases\, and sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal\, and He said to them: \"He who hears you hears me\, and he who rejects you rejects me\, and he who rejects me rejects him who sent me.\" The seventy returned with joy\, saying\, \"Lord\, even the demons are subject to us in your name!\" And he said to them\, \"I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. Behold\, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions\, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall hurt you. Nevertheless do not rejoice in this\, that the spirits are subject to you: but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.\" In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said\, \"I thank you\, Father\, Lord of heaven and earth\, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes; yes\, Father\, for such was your gracious will.\n\n

For I tell you that Christ became a servant to the circumcised to show God's truthfulness\, in order to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs\, and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written\, \"Therefore I will praise thee among the Gentiles\, and sing to thy name\"; and again it is said\, \"Rejoice\, O Gentiles\, with his people\"; and again\, \"Praise the Lord\, all Gentiles\, and let all the peoples praise him\"; and further Isaiah says\, \"The root of Jesse shall come\, he who rises to rule the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles hope.\" May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing\, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope. I myself am satisfied about you\, my brethren\, that you yourselves are full of goodness\, filled with all knowledge\, and able to instruct one another. But on some points I have written to you very boldly by way of reminder\, because of the grace given me by God to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God\, so that the offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable\, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 12:38-45\nAt that time\, the scribes and Pharisees came to Jesus saying\, \"Teacher\, we wish to see a sign from you.\" But he answered them\, \"An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign; but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale\, so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. The men of Nineveh will arise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah\, and behold\, something greater than Jonah is here. The queen of the South will arise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon\, and behold\, something greater than Solomon is here.\n\n\"When the unclean spirit has gone out of a man\, he passes through waterless places seeking rest\, but he finds none. Then he says\, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' And when he comes he finds it empty\, swept\, and put in order. Then he goes and brings with him seven other spirits more evil than himself\, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So shall it be also with this evil generation.\"\n\n

For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has wrought through me to win obedience from the Gentiles\, by word and deed\, by the power of signs and wonders\, by the power of the Holy Spirit\, so that from Jerusalem and as far round as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ\, thus making it my ambition to preach the gospel\, not where Christ has already been named\, lest I build on another man's foundation\, but as it is written\, \"They shall see who have never been told of him\, and they shall understand who have never heard of him.\" This is the reason why I have so often been hindered from coming to you. But now\, since I no longer have any room for work in these regions\, and since I have longed for many years to come to you\, I hope to see you in passing as I go to Spain\, and to be sped on my journey there by you\, once I have enjoyed your company for a little. At present\, however\, I am going to Jerusalem with aid for the saints. For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make some contribution for the poor among the saints at Jerusalem; they were pleased to do it\, and indeed - they are in debt to them\, for if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings\, they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings. When therefore I have completed this\, and have sealed to them this fruit\, I shall go on by way of you to Spain; and I know that when I come to you I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 12:46-50; 13:1-3\nAt that time\, while Jesus was speaking to the people\, behold\, his mother and his brothers stood outside\, asking to speak to him. But he replied to the man who told him\, \"Who is my mother\, and who are my brothers?\" And stretching out his hand toward his disciples\, he said\, \"Here are my mother and my brothers! For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother\, and sister\, and mother.\"\n\nThat same day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea. And great crowds gathered about him\, so that he entered a boat and sat there; and the whole crowd stood on the beach. And he told them many things in parables.\n\n

We are treated as impostors\, and yet are true; as unknown\, and yet well known; as dying\, and behold we live; as punished\, and yet not killed; as sorrowful\, yet always rejoicing; as poor\, yet making many rich; as having nothing\, and yet possessing everything.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 7:36-50\nAt that time\, one of the Pharisees asked Jesus to eat with him\, and he went into the Pharisee's house\, and took his place at table. And behold\, a woman of the city\, who was a sinner\, when she learned that he was at table in the Pharisee's house\, brought an alabaster flask of ointment\, and standing behind him at his feet\, weeping\, she began to wet his feet with her tears\, and wiped them with the hair of her head\, and kissed his feet\, and anointed them with the ointment. Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it\, he said to himself\, \"If this man were a prophet\, he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him\, for she is a sinner.\" And Jesus answering said to him\, \"Simon\, I have something to say to you.\" And he answered\, \"What is it\, Teacher?\" \"A certain creditor had two debtors; one owed five hundred denarii\, and the other fifty. When they could not pay\, he forgave them both. Now which of them will love him more?\" Simon answered\, \"The one\, I suppose\, to whom he forgave more.\" And he said to him\, \"You have judged rightly.\" Then turning toward the woman he said to Simon\, \"Do you see this woman? I entered your house\, you gave me no water for my feet\, but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. You gave me no kiss\, but from the time I came in she has not ceased to kiss my feet. You did not anoint my head with oil\, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. Therefore I tell you\, her sins\, which are many\, are forgiven\, for she loved much; but he who is forgiven little\, loves little.\" And he said to her\, \"Your sins are forgiven.\" Then those who were at table with him began to say among themselves\, \"Who is this\, who even forgives sins?\" And he said to the woman\, \"Your faith has saved you; go in peace.\"\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 07/12/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Proclus & Hilary the Martyrs of Ancyra; Our Holy Father Michael of Maleinus; Gerasimos of Byzantium and Akakios the young ascetic; Paisios the Athonite; Veronica\, the woman with the issue of blood who was healed by Jesus; Andre the Commander & his Companion Martyrs\n\nEpistle Reading: Romans 8:14-21\nBrethren\, all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.\n\nFor you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear\, but you have received the spirit of sonship. When we cry\, \"Abba! Father!\" it is the Spirit himself bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God\, and if children\, then heirs\, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ\, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.\n\nI consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God; for the creation was subjected to futility\, not of its own will but by the will of him who subjected it in hope; because the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the glorious liberty of the children of God.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 9:9-13\nAt that time\, as Jesus passed on\, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax office; and he said to him\, \"Follow me.\" And he rose and followed him.\n\nAnd as he sat at table in the house\, behold\, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples. And when the Pharisees saw this\, they said to his disciples\, \"Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?\" But when he heard it\, he said\, \"Those who are well have no need of a physician\, but those who are sick. Go and learn what this means\, 'I desire mercy\, and not sacrifice.' For I came not to call the righteous\, but sinners to repentance.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Sunday of the Holy Fathers of the 4th Ecumenical Council
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 07/13/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Sunday of the Holy Fathers of the 4th Ecumenical Council; Synaxis of Archangel Gabriel; Stephen of Mar Sabbas Monastery; Holy Martyr Golinduc; Marcian the Martyr of Iconium; Serapion the Martyr\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Luke 24:12-35\nAt that time\, [Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in\, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home wondering at what had happened. That very day] two of them were going to a village named Emmaus\, about seven miles from Jerusalem\, and talking with each other about all these things that had happened. While they were talking and discussing together\, Jesus Himself drew near and went with them. But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him. And He said to them\, \"What is this conversation which you are holding with each other as you walk?\" and they stood still\, looking sad. Then one of them\, named Cleopas\, answered Him\, \"Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?\" And He said to them\, \"What things?\" And they said to him\, \"Concerning Jesus of Nazareth\, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people\, and how our chief priests and rulers delivered Him up to be condemned to death\, and crucified Him. But we had hoped that He was the one to redeem Israel. Yes\, and besides all this\, it is now the third day since this happened. Moreover\, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning and did not find His body; and they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels\, who said that He was alive. Some of those who were with us went to the tomb\, and found it just as the women had said; but Him they did not see.\" And He said to them\, \"O foolish men\, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Was not it necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into this glory?\" And beginning with Moses and all the prophets\, He interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning Himself. So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He appeared to be going further\, but they constrained Him\, saying\, \"Stay with us\, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.\" So He went in to stay with them. When He was at table with them\, He took the bread and blessed\, and broke it\, and gave it to them. And their eyes were opened and they recognized Him; and He vanished out of their sight. They said to each other\, \"Did not our hearts burn within us while He talked to us on the road\, while He opened to us the scriptures?\" And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven gathered together and those who were with them\, who said\, \"The Lord has risen indeed\, and has appeared to Simon!\" Then they told what had happened on the road and how He was known to them in the breaking of the bread.\n\nEpistle Reading: Titus 3:8-15\nTitus\, my son\, the saying is sure.  I desire you to insist on these things\, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to apply themselves to good deeds; these are excellent and profitable to men.  But avoid stupid controversies\, genealogies\, dissensions\, and quarrels over the law\, for they are unprofitable and futile.  As for a man who is factious\, after admonishing him once or twice\, have nothing more to do with him\, knowing that such a person is perverted and sinful; he is self-condemned.\n\nWhen I send Artemas or Tychicos to you\, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis\, for I have decided to spend the winter there.  Do your best to speed Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way; see that they lack nothing.  And let our people learn to apply themselves to good deeds\, so as to help cases of urgent need\, and not to be unfruitful.\n\nAll who are with me send greeting to you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 5:14-19\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"You are the light of the world.  A city set on a hill cannot be hid.  Nor do men light a lamp and put it under a bushel\, but on a stand\, and it gives light to all in the house.  Let your light so shine before men\, that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.  Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfill them.  For truly\, I say to you\, till heaven and earth pass away\, not an iota\, not a dot\, will pass from the law until all is accomplished.  Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so\, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Aquila the Apostle among the 70
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 07/14/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Aquila the Apostle among the 70; Our Holy Father Joseph the Confessor\, Archbishop of Thessalonica; Nicodemus the Righteous of Mount Athos; Peter the New Hieromartyr and the four New Martyrs of Melissourgeio Kissamos; Justus the Martyr\n\nEpistle Reading: Romans 16:1-16\nBrethren\, I commend to you our sister Phoebe\, a deaconess of the church at Cenchreai\, that you may receive her in the Lord as befits the saints\, and help her in whatever she may require from you\, for she has been a helper of many and of myself as well. Greet Prisca and Aquila\, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus\, who risked their necks for my life\, to whom not only I but also all the churches of the Gentiles give thanks; greet also the church in their house. Greet my beloved Epainetos\, who was the first convert in Asia for Christ. Greet Mary\, who has worked hard among you. Greet Andronicos and Junias\, my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners; they are men of note among the apostles\, and they were in Christ before me. Greet Ampliatos\, my beloved in the Lord. Greet Urbanus\, our fellow worker in Christ\, and my beloved Stachys. Greet Apelles\, who is approved in Christ. Greet those who belong to the family of Aristobulos. Greet my kinsman Herodion. Greet those in the Lord who belong to the family of Narcissos. Greet those workers in the Lord\, Tryphaina and Tryphosa. Greet the beloved Persis\, who has worked hard in the Lord. Greet Rufus\, eminent in the Lord\, also his mother and mine. Greet Asyncritos\, Phlegon\, Hermes\, Patrobas\, Hermas\, and the brethren who are with them. Greet Philologos\, Julia\, Nereus and his sister\, and Olympas\, and all the saints who are with them. Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 13:10-23\,43\nAt that time\, the disciples of Jesus came to him and said to him\, \"Why do you speak to the crowds in parables?\" And he answered them\, \"To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven\, but to them it has not been given. For to him who has will more be given\, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not\, even what he has will be taken away. This is why I speak to them in parables\, because seeing they do not see\, and hearing they do not hear\, nor do they understand. With them indeed is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says: 'You shall indeed hear but never understand\, and you shall indeed see but never perceive. For this people's heart has grown dull\, and their ears are heavy of hearing\, and their eyes they have closed\, lest they should perceive with their eyes\, and hear with their ears\, and understand with their heart\, and turn for me to heal them.' But blessed are your eyes\, for they see\, and your ears\, for they hear. Truly\, I say to you\, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see\, and did not see it\, and to hear what you hear\, and did not hear it.\n\n\"Hear then the parable of the sower. When any one hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it\, the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in his heart; this is what was sown along the path. As for what was sown on rocky ground\, this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy; yet he has no root in himself\, but endures for a while\, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word\, immediately he falls away. As for what was sown among thorns\, this is he who hears the word\, but the cares of the world and the delight in riches choke the word\, and it proves unfruitful. As for what was sown on good soil\, this is he who hears the word and understands it; he indeed bears fruit\, and yields\, in one case a hundredfold\, in another sixty\, and in another thirty. He who has ears to hear\, let him hear.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:The Holy Martyrs Cyricus and His Mother Julitta
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 07/15/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: The Holy Martyrs Cyricus and His Mother Julitta; Vladimir\, Equal-to-the-Apostles of Kiev; The Finding of the Head of St. Matrona of Chios; Donald and his Nine Daughters; Swithun\, Bishop of Winchester\n\nEpistle Reading: I Corinthians 13:11-14;14:1-5\nBRETHREN\, when I was a child\, I spoke like a child\, I thought like a child\, I reasoned like a child; when I became a man\, I gave up childish ways. For now we see in a mirror dimly\, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall understand fully\, even as I have been fully understood. So faith\, hope\, love abide\, these three; but the greatest of these is love. Make love your aim\, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts\, especially that you may prophesy. For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him\, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit. On the other hand\, he who prophesies speaks to men for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation. He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself\, but he who prophesies edifies the church. Now I want you all to speak in tongues\, but even more to prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than he who speaks in tongues\, unless some one interprets\, so that the church may be edified. \n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 17:24-27; 18:1-4\nAt that time\, the collectors of the half-shekel tax went up to Peter and said\, \"Does not your teacher pay the tax?\" He said\, \"Yes.\" And when he came home\, Jesus spoke to him first\, saying\, \"What do you think\, Simon? From whom do kings of the earth take toll or tribute? From their sons or from others?\" And when he said\, \"From others\,\" Jesus said to him\, \"Then the sons are free. However\, not to give offense to them\, go to the sea and cast a hook\, and take the first fish that comes up\, and when you open its mouth you will find a shekel; take that and give it to them for me and for yourself.\"\n\n  At that time the disciples came to Jesus\, saying\, \"Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?\" And calling to him a child\, he put him in the midst of them\, and said\, \"Truly\, I say to you\, unless you turn and become like children\, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Whoever humbles himself like this child\, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Athenogenes the Holy Martyr of Heracleopolis
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 07/16/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Athenogenes the Holy Martyr of Heracleopolis; Julia the Virgin-martyr of Carthage; 1\,015 Martyrs in Pisidia; Helier the Hermit\, Martyr of Jersey\n\nStrict Fast\n\nEpistle Reading: I Corinthians 2:9-16;3:1-8\nBrethren\, \"What no eye has seen\, nor ear heard\, nor the heart of man conceived\, what God has prepared for those who love him\,\" God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything\, even the depths of God. For what person knows a man's thoughts except the spirit of the man which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. Now we have received not the spirit of the world\, but the Spirit which is from God\, that we might understand the gifts bestowed on us by God. And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit\, comparing spiritual things with spiritual truths to those who possess the Spirit. The unspiritual man does not receive the gifts of the Spirit of God\, for they are folly to him\, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned. The spiritual man judges all things\, but is himself to be judged by no one. \"For who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?\" But we have the mind of Christ. But I\, brethren\, could not address you as spiritual men\, but as men of the flesh\, as babes in Christ. I fed you with milk\, not solid food; for you were not ready for it; and even yet you are not ready\, for you are still of the flesh. For while there is jealousy and strife among you\, are you not of the flesh\, and behaving like ordinary men? For when one says\, \"I belong to Paul\,\" and another\, \"I belong to Apollos\,\" are you not merely men? What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Servants through whom you believed\, as the Lord assigned to each. I planted\, Apollos watered\, but God gave the growth. So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything\, but only God who gives the growth. He who plants and he who waters are equal\, and each shall receive his wages according to his labor.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 13:31-36\nThe Lord said this parable\, \"The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field; it is the smallest of all seeds\, but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree\, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.\" He told them another parable. \"The kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour\, till it was all leavened.\"\n\nAll this Jesus said to the crowds in parables; indeed he said nothing to them without a parable. This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet: \"I will open my mouth in parables\, I will utter what has been hidden since the foundation of the world.\" Then Jesus left the crowds and went into the house.\n\n

SUMMARY:The Holy Great Martyr Marina (Margaret)
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 07/17/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: The Holy Great Martyr Marina (Margaret); Veronika & Speratos the Martyrs; Holy Royal Martyrs of Russia; Kenelm\, Prince of Mercia\n\nEpistle Reading: Galatians 3:23-29;4:1-5\nBrethren\, before faith came\, we were confined under the law\, kept under restraint until faith should be revealed. So that the law was our custodian until Christ came\, that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come\, we are no longer under a custodian; for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God\, through faith. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek\, there is neither slave nor free\, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you are Christ's\, then you are Abraham's offspring\, heirs according to promise. I mean that the heir\, as long as he is a child\, is no better than a slave\, though he is the owner of all the estate; but he is under guardians and trustees until the date set by the father. So with us; when we were children\, we were slaves to the elemental spirits of the universe. But when the time had fully come\, God sent forth his Son\, born of a woman\, born under the law\, to redeem those who were under the law\, so that we might receive adoption as sons.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 5:24-34\nAt that time\, a great crowd followed Jesus and thronged about him. And there was a woman who had had a flow of blood for twelve years\, and who had suffered much under many physicians\, and had spent all that she had\, and was no better but rather grew worse. She had heard the reports about Jesus\, and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment. For she said\, \"If I touch even his garments\, I shall be made well.\" And immediately the hemorrhage ceased; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. And Jesus\, perceiving in himself that power had gone forth from him\, immediately turned about in the crowd\, and said\, \"Who touched my garments?\" And his disciples said to him\, \"You see the crowd pressing around you\, and yet you say\, 'Who touched me?'\" And he looked around to see who had done it. But the woman\, knowing what had been done to her\, came in fear and trembling and fell down before him\, and told him the whole truth. And he said to her\, \"Daughter\, your faith has made you well; go in peace\, and be healed of your disease.\"\n\n

Then every man will receive his commendation from God. I have applied all this to myself and Apollos for your benefit\, brethren\, that you may learn by us not to go beyond what is written\, that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against another. For who sees anything different in you? What have you that you did not receive? If then you received it\, why do you boast as if it were not a gift? Already you are filled! Already you have become rich! Without us you have become kings! And would that you did reign\, so that we might share the rule with you!\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 13:44-54\nThe Lord said this parable\, \"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field\, which a man found and covered up; then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field. \n\n Again\, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls\, who\, on finding one pearl of great value\, went and sold all that he had and bought it. \n\n Again\, the kingdom of heaven is like a net which was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind; when it was full\, men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into vessels but threw away the bad. So it will be at the close of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous\, and throw them into the furnace of fire; there men will weep and gnash their teeth. \n\n Have you understood all this?\" They said to him\, \"Yes.\" And he said to them\, \"Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.\" And when Jesus had finished these parables\, he went away from there\, and coming to his own country he taught them in their synagogue.\n\n

For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brethren\, my kinsmen by race. They are Israelites\, and to them belong the patriarchs\, and of their race\, according to the flesh\, is the Christ\, who is God over all\, blessed for ever. Amen.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 9:18-26\nAt that time\, a ruler came in and knelt before Jesus\, saying\, \"My daughter has just died; but come and lay your hand on her\, and she will live.\" And Jesus rose and followed him\, with his disciples. And behold\, a woman who had suffered from a hemorrhage for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment; for she said to herself\, \"If I only touch his garment\, I shall be made well.\" Jesus turned\, and seeing her he said\, \"Take heart\, daughter; your faith has made you well.\" And instantly the woman was made well. And when Jesus came to the ruler's house\, and saw the flute players\, and the crowd making a tumult\, he said\, \"Depart; for the girl is not dead but sleeping.\" And they laughed at him. But when the crowd had been put outside\, he went in and took her by the hand\, and the girl arose. And the report of this went through all that district.\n\n

SUMMARY:6th Sunday of Matthew
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 07/20/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: 6th Sunday of Matthew; The Glorious Prophet Elias (Elijah); Synaxis of the Russians who were perfected in France: Protopresbyter Alexios Mednedkov\, Presbyter Dimitrii Klepinin\, Mother Maria Skobtsova\, her son Yuri Skobtsov\, and Ilia Fondaminskii; Mother Maria Skobtsova\, New-Martyr of France\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Luke 24:36-53\nAt that time\, having risen from the dead\, Jesus went up and stood among His disciples and said to them\, \"Peace be with you.\" But they were startled and frightened\, and supposed that they saw a spirit. And He said to them\, \"Why are you troubled\, and why do questionings rise in your hearts? See My hands and My feet\, that it is I Myself; handle Me\, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that I have.\" And when He had said this\, He showed them His hands and His feet. And while they still disbelieved for joy\, and wondered\, He said to them\, \"Have you anything here to eat?\" They gave Him a piece of broiled fish [and some honeycomb]\, and He took it and ate before them. Then He said to them\, \"These are My words which I spoke to you\, while I was still with you\, that everything written about Me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled.\" Then He opened their minds to understand the scriptures\, and said to them\, \"Thus it is written\, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead\, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in His name in all nations\, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. And behold\, I send the promise of My Father upon you; but stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.\" Then He led them out as far as Bethany\, and lifting up His hands\, He blessed them. While He blessed them\, He parted from them\, and was carried up into heaven. And they worshiped Him\, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy\, and were continually in the Temple blessing God.\n\nEpistle Reading: James 5:10-20\nBRETHREN\, take as an example of suffering and patience the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. Behold\, we call those happy who were steadfast. You have heard of the steadfastness of Job\, and you have seen the purpose of the Lord\, how the Lord is compassionate and merciful. But above all\, my brethren\, do not swear\, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath\, but let your yes be yes and your no be no\, that you may not fall under condemnation. Is any one among you suffering? Let him pray. Is any cheerful? Let him sing praise. Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church\, and let them pray over him\, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith will save the sick man\, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins\, he will be forgiven. Therefore confess your sins to one another\, and pray for one another\, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man has great power in its effects. Elijah was a man of like nature with ourselves and he prayed fervently that it might not rain\, and for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth. Then he prayed again and the heaven gave rain\, and the earth brought forth its fruit. My brethren\, if any one among you wanders from the truth and some one brings him back\, let him know that whoever brings back a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.Gospel Reading: Matthew 9:1-8\nAt that time\, getting into a boat Jesus crossed over and came to his own city. And behold\, they brought to him a paralytic\, lying on his bed; and when Jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic\, \"Take heart\, my son; your sins are forgiven.\" And behold\, some of the scribes said to themselves\, \"This man is blaspheming.\" But Jesus\, knowing their thoughts\, said\, \"Why do you think evil in your hearts? For which is easier\, to say 'Your sins are forgiven\,' or to say 'Rise and walk?' But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins\" he then said to the paralytic -- \"Rise\, take up your bed and go home.\" And he rose and went home. When the crowds saw it\, they were afraid\, and they glorified God\, who had given such authority to men.\n\n

SUMMARY:John and Symeon the Fool for Christ
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 07/21/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: John and Symeon the Fool for Christ; Parthenios\, Bishop of Arta\n\nEpistle Reading: I Corinthians 5:9-13;6:1-11\nBrethren\, I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with immoral men; not at all meaning the immoral of this world\, or the greedy and robbers\, or idolaters\, since then you would need to go out of the world. But rather I wrote to you not to associate with any one who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of immorality or greed\, or is an idolater\, reviler\, drunkard\, or robber - not even to eat with such a one. For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge? God judges those outside. \"Drive out the wicked person from among you.\" When one of you has a grievance against a brother\, does he dare go to law before the unrighteous instead of the saints? Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you\, are you incompetent to try trivial cases? Do you not know that we are to judge angels? How much more\, matters pertaining to this life! If then you have such cases\, why do you lay them before those who are least esteemed by the church? I say this to your shame. Can it be that there is no man among you wise enough to decide between members of the brotherhood\, but brother goes to law against brother and that before unbelievers? To have lawsuits at all with one another is defeat for you. Why not rather suffer wrong? Why not rather be defrauded? But you yourselves wrong and defraud\, and that even your own brethren. Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither the immoral\, nor idolators\, nor adulterers\, nor sexual perverts\, nor thieves\, nor the greedy\, nor drunkards\, nor revilers\, nor robbers will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you. But you were washed\, you were sanctified\, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 13:54-58\nAt that time\, Jesus came to his own country\, and taught the people in their synagogue so that they were astonished\, and said\, \"Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works? Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all this?\" And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them\, \"A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.\" And he did not do many mighty works there\, because of their unbelief.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 07/22/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Mary Magdalene\, the Holy Myrrh-bearer and Equal to the Apostles; Markella\, the Virgin-martyr of Chios\n\nEpistle Reading: I Corinthians 9:2-12\nBrethren\, you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord. This is my defense to those who would examine me. Do we not have the right to our food and drink? Do we not have the right to be accompanied by a wife\, as the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas? Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working for a living? Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard without eating any of its fruit? Who tends a flock without getting some of the milk? Do I say this on human authority? Does not the law say the same? For it is written in the law of Moses\, \"You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the grain.\" Is it for oxen that God is concerned? Does he not speak entirely for our sake? It was written for our sake\, because the plowman should plow in hope and the thresher thresh in hope of a share in the crop. If we have sown spiritual good among you\, is it too much if we reap your material benefits? If others share this rightful claim upon you\, do not we still more? Nevertheless\, we have not made use of this right\, but we endure anything rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 8:1-3\nAt that time Jesus went on through cities and villages\, preaching and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God. And the twelve were with him\, and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary\, called Magdalene\, from whom seven demons had gone out\, and Joanna\, the wife of Chuza\, Herod's steward\, and Susanna\, and many others\, who provided for him out of their means.\n\n

SUMMARY:Phocas the Holy Martyr\, Bishop of Sinope
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 07/23/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Phocas the Holy Martyr\, Bishop of Sinope; Ezekiel the Prophet; Pelagia the Righteous of Tinos; Trophimos & Theophilios and the 13 others martyred in Lycia; St. Anna of Levkadio; The Icons of the Most Holy Theotokos of Pochaev; Icon of the Mother of God\n\nStrict Fast\n\nEpistle Reading: I Corinthians 7:12-24\nBrethren\, if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever\, and she consents to live with him\, he should not divorce her. If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever\, and he consents to live with her\, she should not divorce him. For the unbelieving husband is consecrated through his wife\, and the unbelieving wife is consecrated through her husband. Otherwise\, your children would be unclean\, but as it is they are holy. But if the unbelieving partner desires to separate\, let it be so; in such a case the brother or sister is not bound. For God has called us to peace. Wife\, how do you know whether you will save your husband? Husband\, how do you know whether you will save your wife? Only\, let every one lead the life which the Lord has assigned to him\, and in which God has called him. This is my rule in all the churches. Was any one at the time of his call already circumcised? Let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision. Was any one at the time of his call uncircumcised? Let him not seek circumcision. For neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision\, but keeping the commandments of God. Every one should remain in the state in which he was called. Were you a slave when called? Never mind. But if you can gain your freedom\, avail yourself of the opportunity. \nFor he who was called in the Lord as a slave is a freedman of the Lord. Likewise he who was free when called is a slave of Christ. You were bought with a price; do not become slaves of men. So\, brethren\, in whatever state each was called\, there let him remain with God.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 14:35-36;15:1-11\nAt that time\, when the men of Gennesaret recognized Jesus\, they sent round to all that region and brought to him all that were sick\, and besought him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched it were made well.\n\nThen Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said\, \"Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat.\" He answered them\, \"And why do you transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition? For God commanded\, 'Honor your father and your mother\,' and\, 'He who speaks evil of father or mother\, let him surely die.' But you say\, 'If any one tells his father or his mother\, What you would have gained from me is given to God\, he need not honor his father.' So\, for the sake of your tradition\, you have made void the word of God. You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you\, when he said: 'This people honors me with their lips\, but their heart is far from me; in vain do they worship me\, teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.' \" And he called the people to him and said to them\, \"Hear and understand: not what goes into the mouth defiles a man\, but what comes out of the mouth\, this defiles a man.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Christina the Great Martyr of Tyre
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 07/24/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Christina the Great Martyr of Tyre; Athenagorus the Apologist; Boris and Gleb\, the Passion-bearers; Kapiton\, Himenaos and Hermogenes\, the Martyrs; Theophilos the New Martyr of Zakynthos\n\nEpistle Reading: I Corinthians 7:24-35\nBrethren\, in whatever state each was called\, there let him remain with God. Now concerning the virgins\, I have no command of the Lord\, but I give my opinion as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy. I think that in view of the present distress it is well for a person to remain as he is. Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek marriage. But if you marry\, you do not sin\, and if a virgin marries she does not sin. Yet those who marry will have worldly troubles\, and I would spare you that. I mean\, brethren\, the appointed time has grown very short; from now on\, let those who have wives live as though they had none\, and those who mourn as though they were not mourning\, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing\, and those who buy as though they had no goods\, and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it. For the form of this world is passing away. I want you to be free from anxieties. The unmarried man is anxious about the affairs of the Lord\, how to please the Lord; but the married man is anxious about worldly affairs\, how to please his wife\, and his interests are divided. And the unmarried woman or girl is anxious about the affairs of the Lord\, how to be holy in body and spirit; but the married woman is anxious about worldly affairs\, how to please her husband. I say this for your own benefit\, not to lay any restraint upon you\, but to promote good order and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 15:12-21\nAt that time\, the disciples came to Jesus and said to him\, \"Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?\" He answered\, \"Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up. Let them alone; they are blind guides. And if a blind man leads a blind man\, both will fall into a pit.\" But Peter said to him\, \"Explain the parable to us.\" And he said\, \"Are you also still without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach\, and so passes on? But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart\, and this defiles a man. For out of the heart come evil thoughts\, murder\, adultery\, fornication\, theft\, false witness\, slander. These are what defile a man; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.\" And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon.\n\n

SUMMARY:Dormition of St. Anna\, mother of the Theotokos
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 07/25/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Dormition of St. Anna\, mother of the Theotokos; Olympias the Deaconess; Eupraxia & Julia the Righteous of Tabenna; Gregory Kallidis\, Metropolitan of Heraclea; Memory of the Fifth Ecumenical Council in Constantinople (553)\n\nFast Day (Wine and Oil Allowed)\n\nEpistle Reading: Galatians 4:22-27\nBrethren\, Abraham had two sons\, one by a slave and one by a free woman. But the son of the slave was born according to the flesh\, the son of the free woman through promise. Now this is an allegory: these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai\, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar. Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; she corresponds to the present Jerusalem\, for she is in slavery with her children. But the Jerusalem above is free\, and she is our mother. For it is written\, \"Rejoice\, O barren one who does not bear; break forth and shout\, you who are not in travail; for the children of the desolate one are many more than the children of her that is married.\"\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 8:16-21\nThe Lord said\, \"No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a vessel\, or puts it under a bed\, but puts it on a stand\, that those who enter may see the light. For nothing is hid that shall not be made manifest\, nor anything secret that shall not be known and come to light. Take heed then how you hear; for to him who has will more be given\, and from him who has not\, even what he thinks that he has will be taken away.\"\n\nThen his mother and his brothers came to him\, but they could not reach him for the crowd. And he was told\, \"Your mother and your brothers are standing outside\, desiring to see you.\" But he said to them\, \"My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.\"\n\n

So that the law was our custodian until Christ came\, that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come\, we are no longer under a custodian; for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God\, through faith. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek\, there is neither slave nor free\, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you are Christ's\, then you are Abraham's offspring\, heirs according to promise. I mean that the heir\, as long as he is a child\, is no better than a slave\, though he is the owner of all the estate; but he is under guardians and trustees until the date set by the father. So with us; when we were children\, we were slaves to the elemental spirits of the universe. But when the time had fully come\, God sent forth his Son\, born of a woman\, born under the law\, to redeem those who were under the law\, so that we might receive adoption as sons.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 5:24-34\nAt that time\, a great crowd followed Jesus and thronged about him. And there was a woman who had had a flow of blood for twelve years\, and who had suffered much under many physicians\, and had spent all that she had\, and was no better but rather grew worse. She had heard the reports about Jesus\, and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment. For she said\, \"If I touch even his garments\, I shall be made well.\" And immediately the hemorrhage ceased; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. And Jesus\, perceiving in himself that power had gone forth from him\, immediately turned about in the crowd\, and said\, \"Who touched my garments?\" And his disciples said to him\, \"You see the crowd pressing around you\, and yet you say\, 'Who touched me?'\" And he looked around to see who had done it. But the woman\, knowing what had been done to her\, came in fear and trembling and fell down before him\, and told him the whole truth. And he said to her\, \"Daughter\, your faith has made you well; go in peace\, and be healed of your disease.\"\n\n

So she ran\, and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple\, the one whom Jesus loved\, and said to them\, \"They have taken the Lord out of the tomb\, and we do not know where they have laid Him.\" Peter then came out with the other disciple\, and they went toward the tomb. They both ran\, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first; and stooping to look in\, he saw the linen cloths lying there\, but he did not go in. Then Simon Peter came\, following him\, and went into the tomb; he saw the linen cloths lying and the napkin\, which had been on His head\, not lying with the linen cloths\, but rolled up in a place by itself. Then the other disciple\, who reached the tomb first\, also went in\, and he saw and believed; for as yet they did not know the scripture\, that He must rise from the dead. Then the disciples went back to their homes.\n\nEpistle Reading: II Timothy 2:1-10\nTimothy\, my son\, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus\, and what you have heard from me before many witnesses entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also. Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. No soldier on service gets entangled in civilian pursuits\, since his aim is to satisfy the one who enlisted him. An athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. It is the hardworking farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops. Think over what I say\, for the Lord will grant you understanding in everything.\n\nRemember Jesus Christ\, risen from the dead\, descended from David\, as preached in my gospel\, the gospel for which I am suffering and wearing fetters like a criminal. But the word of God is not fettered. Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect\, that they also may obtain salvation in Christ Jesus with its eternal glory.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 9:27-35\nAt that time\, as Jesus passed by\, two blind men followed him\, crying aloud\, \"Have mercy on us\, Son of David.\" When he entered the house\, the blind men came to him; and Jesus said to them\, \"Do you believe that I am able to do this?\" They said to him\, \"Yes\, Lord.\" Then he touched their eyes\, saying\, \"According to your faith be it done to you.\" And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly charged them\, \"See that no one knows it.\" But they went away and spread his fame through all that district.\n\nAs they were going away\, behold\, a dumb demoniac was brought to him. And when the demon had been cast out\, the dumb man spoke; and the crowds marveled\, saying\, \"Never was anything like this seen in Israel.\" But the Pharisees said\, \"He casts out demons by the prince of demons.\"\n\nAnd Jesus went about all the cities and villages\, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom\, and healing every disease and every infirmity among the people.\n\n

And the twelve summoned the body of the disciples and said\, \"it is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables. Therefore\, brethren\, pick out from among you seven men of good repute\, full of the Spirit and of wisdom\, whom we may appoint to this duty. But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.\" And what they said pleased the whole multitude\, and they chose Stephen\, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit\, and Philip\, and Prochoros\, and Nicanor\, and Timon\, and Parmenas\, and Nicolaos\, a proselyte of Antioch. These they set before the apostles\, and they prayed and laid their hands upon them. And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem\, and a great many of the priests were obedient to the faith.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 16:1-6\nAt that time\, the Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and to test him they asked him to show them a sign from heaven. He answered them\, \"When it is evening\, you say\, 'It will be fair weather; for the sky is red.' And in the morning\, 'It will be stormy today\, for the sky is red and threatening.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky\, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times. An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign\, but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah.\" So he left them and departed.\n\nWhen the disciples reached the other side\, they had forgotten to bring any bread. Jesus said to them\, \"Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\"\n\n

Now these things are warnings for us\, not to desire evil as they did. Do not be idolators as some of them were; as it is written\, \"The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to dance.\" We must not indulge in immorality as some of them did\, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day. We must not put Christ to the test\, as some of them did and were destroyed by the Destroyer. Now these things happened to them as a warning\, but they were written down for our instruction\, upon whom the end of the ages has come. Therefore let any one who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 16:6-12\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\" And they discussed it among themselves\, saying\, \"We brought no bread.\" But Jesus\, aware of this\, said\, \"O men of little faith\, why do you discuss among yourselves the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive? Do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand\, and how many baskets you gathered? Or the seven loaves of the four thousand\, and how many baskets you gathered? How is it that you fail to perceive that I did not speak about bread? Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\" Then they understood that he did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread\, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\n\n

And after some days Paul said to Barnabas\, \"Come\, let us return and visit the brethren in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord\, and see how they are.\" And Barnabas wanted to take with them John called Mark. But Paul thought best not to take with them one who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia\, and had not gone with them to the work. And there arose a sharp contention\, so that they separated from each other; Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus\, but Paul chose Silas and departed\, being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord. And he went through Syria and Cilicia\, strengthening the churches. \n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 16:20-24\nAt that time\, Jesus strictly charged the disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ. From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes\, and be killed\, and on the third day be raised. And Peter took him and began to rebuke him\, saying\, \"God forbid\, Lord! This shall never happen to you.\" But he turned and said to Peter\, \"Get behind me\, Satan! You are a hindrance to me; for you are not on the side of God\, but of men.\" Then Jesus told his disciples\, \"If any man would come after me\, let him deny himself\, and take up his cross and follow me.\"\n\n

For why should my liberty be determined by another man's scruples? If I partake with thankfulness\, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks? So\, whether you eat or drink\, or whatever you do\, do all to the glory of God. Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God\, just as I try to please all men in everything I do\, not seeking my own advantage\, but that of many\, that they may be saved. Be imitators of me\, as I am of Christ. I commend you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions even as I have delivered them to you. But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ\, the head of a woman is her husband\, and the head of Christ is God. Any man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head\, but any woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled dishonors her head - it is the same as if her head were shaven. For if a woman will not veil herself\, then she should cut off her hair\, but if it is disgraceful for a woman to be shorn or shaven\, let her wear a veil. For a man ought not to cover his head\, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. (For man was not made from woman\, but woman from man.)\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 16:24-28\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"If any man would come after me\, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it\, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. For what will it profit a man\, if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life? Or what shall a man give in return for his life? For the Son of man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father and then he will repay every man for what he has done. Truly\, I say to you\, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.\"\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 08/01/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: The Holy Seven Maccabee Children\, Solomone Their Mother\, and Eleazar Their Teacher; Procession of the Precious Cross; Timothy the Wonderworker\, Archbishop of Priconissus; Elesa the Righteous-Martyr of Kythira\n\nStrict Fast\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 11:33-40;12:1-2\nBrethren\, all the saints through faith conquered kingdoms\, enforced justice\, received promises\, stopped the mouths of lions\, quenched raging fire\, escaped the edge of the sword\, won strength out of weakness\, became mighty in war\, put foreign armies to flight. Women received their dead by resurrection. Some were tortured\, refusing to accept release\, that they might rise again to a better life. Others suffered mocking and scourging\, and even chains and imprisonment. They were stoned\, they were sawn in two\, they were tempted\, they were killed with the sword; they went about in skins of sheep and goats\, destitute\, afflicted\, ill-treated - of whom the world was not worthy - wandering         over deserts and mountains and in dens and caves of the earth. And all these\, though well attested by their faith\, did not receive what was promised\, since God had foreseen something better for us\, that apart from us they should not be made perfect. Therefore\, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses\, let us also lay aside every weight\, and sin which clings so closely\, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us\, looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 10:16-22\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"Behold\, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves; so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. Beware of men; for they will deliver you up to councils\, and flog you in their synagogues\, and you will be dragged before governors and kings for my sake\, to bear testimony before them and the Gentiles. When they deliver you up\, do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say; for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour; for it is not you who speak\, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. Brother will deliver up brother to death\, and the father his child\, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death; and you will be hated by all for my name's sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Translation of the Relics of Stephen the Protomartyr
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 08/02/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Translation of the Relics of Stephen the Protomartyr; Holy Glorious New Martyr Theodore of Dardanelles; Phocas the Martyr; Plegmund\, Archbishop of Canterbury\n\nFast Day (Wine and Oil Allowed)\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 6:8-15;7:1-5\,47-60\nIn those days\, Stephen\, full of grace and power\, did great wonders and signs among the people. Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called)\, and of the Cyrenians\, and of the Alexandrians\, and of those from Cilicia and Asia\, arose and disputed with Stephen. But they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke. Then they secretly instigated men\, who said\, \"We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.\" And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes\, and they came upon him and seized him and brought him before the council\, and set up false witnesses who said\, \"This man never ceases to speak words against this holy place and the law; for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place\, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.\" And gazing at him\, all who sat in the council saw that his face was like the face of an angel.\n\nAnd the high priest said\, \"Is this so?\" And Stephen said: \"Brethren and fathers\, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham\, when he was in Mesopotamia\, before he lived in Haran\, and said to him\, 'Depart from your land and from your kindred and go into the land which I will show you.' Then he departed from the land of the Chaldeans\, and lived in Haran. And after his father died\, God removed him from there into this land in which you are now living; yet he gave him no inheritance in it\, not even a foot's length\, but promised to give it to him in possession and to his posterity after him\, though he had no child.\n\n\"But it was Solomon who built a house for him. Yet the Most High does not dwell in houses made with hands; as the prophet says\, 'Heaven is my throne\, and earth my footstool. What house will you build for me\, says the Lord\, or what is the place of my rest? Did not my hand make all these things?'\n\n\"You stiff-necked people\, uncircumcised in heart and ears\, you always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did\, so do you. Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One\, whom you have now betrayed and murdered\, you who received the law as delivered by angels and did not keep it.\"\n\nNow when they heard these things they were enraged\, and they ground their teeth against him. But he\, full of the Holy Spirit\, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God\, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God; and he said\, \"Behold\, I see the heavens opened\, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God.\" But they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and rushed together upon him. Then they cast him out of the city and stoned him; and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul. And as they were stoning Stephen\, he prayed\, \"Lord Jesus\, receive my spirit.\" And he knelt down and cried with a loud voice\, \"Lord\, do not hold this sin against them.\" And when he had said this\, he fell asleep.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 12:1-12\nThe Lord said this parable\, \"A man planted a vineyard\, and set a hedge around it\, and dug a pit for the wine press\, and built a tower\, and let it out to tenants\, and went into another country. When the time came\, he sent a servant to the tenants\, to get from them some of the fruit of the vineyard. And they took him and beat him\, and sent him away empty handed. Again he sent to them another servant\, and they wounded him in the head\, and treated him shamefully. And he sent another\, and him they killed; and so with many others\, some they beat and some they killed. He had still one other\, a beloved son; finally he sent him to them\, saying\, 'They will respect my son.' But those tenants said to one another\, 'This is the heir; come\, let us kill him\, and the inheritance will be ours.' And they took him and killed him\, and cast him out of the vineyard. What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants\, and give the vineyard to others. Have you not read this scripture: 'The very stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner; this was the Lord's doing\, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?\" And they tried to arrest him\, but feared the multitude\, for they perceived that he had told the parable against them; so they left him and went away.\n\n

SUMMARY:8th Sunday of Matthew
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 08/03/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: 8th Sunday of Matthew; Isaacius\, Dalmatus\, & Faustus\, Ascetics of the Dalmation Monastery; Salome the Holy Myrrhbearer; Theoctistus the Wonderworker\n\nFast Day (Wine and Oil Allowed)\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: John 20:11-18\nAt that time\, Mary stood weeping outside the tomb\, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb\, and she saw two angels in white\, sitting where the body of Jesus has lain\, one at the head and one at the feet. They said to her\, \"Woman\, why are you weeping?\" She said to them\, \"Because they have taken away my Lord\, and I do not know where they have laid Him.\" Saying this\, she turned round and saw Jesus standing\, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her\, \"Woman\, why are you weeping? Whom do you seek?\" Supposing Him to be the gardener\, she said to Him\, \"Sir\, if you have carried Him away\, tell me where you have laid Him\, and I will take Him away.\" Jesus said to her\, \"Mary.\" She turned and said to Him in Hebrew\, \"Rabboni\,\" which means Teacher. Jesus said to her\, \"Do not touch Me\, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brethren and say to them\, I am ascending to My Father and your Father\, to My God and your God.\" Mary Magdalene went and said to the disciples\, \"I have seen the Lord\,\" and she told them that He had said these things to her.\n\nEpistle Reading: I Corinthians 1:10-17\nBrethren\, I appeal to you by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ\, that all of you agree and that there be no dissensions among you\, but that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment. For it has been reported to me by Chloe's people that there is quarreling among you\, my brethren. What I mean is that each one of you says\, \"I belong to Paul\,\" or \"I belong to Apollos\,\" or \"I belong to Cephas\,\" or \"I belong to Christ.\" Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispos and Gaius; lest any one should say that you were baptized in my name. (I did baptize also the household of Stephanas. Beyond that\, I do not know whether I baptized any one else.) For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel\, and not with eloquent wisdom\, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 14:14-22\nAt that time\, Jesus saw a great throng; and he had compassion on them\, and healed their sick. When it was evening\, the disciples came to him and said\, \"This is a lonely place\, and the day is now over; send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves.\" Jesus said\, \"They need not go away; you give them something to eat.\" They said to him\, \"We have only five loaves here and two fish.\" And he said\, \"Bring them here to me.\" Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass; and taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven\, and blessed\, and broke and gave the loaves to the crowds. And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces left over. And those who ate were about five thousand men\, besides women and children. Then he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side\, while he dismissed the crowds.\n\n

SUMMARY:Seven Holy Youths of Ephesus
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 08/04/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Seven Holy Youths of Ephesus\n\nStrict Fast\n\nEpistle Reading: I Corinthians 11:31-34;12:1-6\nBrethren\, if we judged ourselves truly\, we should not be judged. But when we are judged by the Lord\, we are chastened so that we may not be condemned along with the world. So then\, my brethren\, when you come together to eat\, wait for one another - if any one is hungry\, let him eat at home - lest you come together to be condemned. About the other things I will give directions when I come. Now concerning the spiritual gifts\, brethren\, I do not want you to be uninformed. You know that when you were heathen\, you were led astray to dumb idols\, however you may have been moved. Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking by the Spirit of God ever says \"Jesus be cursed!\" and no one can say \"Jesus is Lord\" except by the Holy Spirit. Now there are varieties of gifts\, but the same spirit; and there are varieties of service\, but the same Lord; and there are varieties of working\, but it is the same God who inspires them all in every one.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 18:1-11\nAt that time\, the disciples came to Jesus\, saying\, \"Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?\" And calling to him a child\, he put him in the midst of them and said\, \"Truly\, I say to you\, unless you turn and become like children\, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Whoever humbles himself like this child\, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.\n\n\"Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me; but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin\, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened round his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.\n\n\"Woe to the world for temptations to sin! For it is necessary that temptations come\, but woe to the man by whom the temptation comes! And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin\, cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to enter life maimed or lame than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into the eternal fire. And if your eye causes you to sin\, pluck it out and throw it away; it is better for you to enter life with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into the Gehenna of fire.\n\n\"See that you do not despise one of these little ones; for I tell you that in heaven their angels always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven. For the Son of man came to save the lost.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Forefeast of the Transfiguration of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 08/05/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Forefeast of the Transfiguration of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ; Eusignius the Martyr of Antioch; Our Righteous Father Eugene of Aitola; Euthymios\, Patriarch of Constantinople; Christos the New Martyr of Prevezis; Oswald the Martyr\, King of Northumbria\n\nStrict Fast\n\nEpistle Reading: I Peter 1:1-25;2:1-10\nPeter\, an apostle of Jesus Christ\, to the exiles of the Dispersion in Pontos\, Galatia\, Cappadocia\, Asia\, and Bithynia\, chosen and destined by God the Father and sanctified by the Spirit for obedience to Jesus Christ and for sprinkling with his blood:\n\nMay grace and peace be multiplied to you. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! By his great mercy we have been born anew to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead\, and to an inheritance which is imperishable\, undefiled\, and unfading\, kept in heaven for you\, who by God's power are guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. In this you rejoice\, though now for a little while you may have to suffer various trials\, so that the genuineness of your faith\, more precious than gold which though perishable is tested by fire\, may redound to praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ. Without having known him you love him; though you do not now see him you believe in him and rejoice with unutterable and exalted joy. As the outcome of your faith you obtain the salvation of your souls.\n\nThe prophets who prophesied of the grace that was to be yours searched and inquired about this salvation; they inquired what person or time was indicated by the Spirit of Christ within them when predicting the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glory. It was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you\, in the things which have now been announced to you by those who preached the good news to you through the Holy Spirit sent from heaven\, things into which angels long to look.\n\nTherefore gird up your minds\, be sober\, set your hope fully upon the grace that is coming to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. As obedient children\, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance\, but as he who called you is holy\, be holy yourselves in all your conduct; since it is written\, \"You shall be holy\, for I am holy.\" And if you invoke as Father him who judges each one impartially according to his deeds\, conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile. You know that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your fathers\, not with perishable things such as silver or gold\, but with the precious blood of Christ\, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot. He was destined before the foundation of the world but was made manifest at the end of the times for your sake. Through him you have confidence in God\, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory\, so that your faith and hope are in God.\n\nHaving purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for a sincere love of the brethren\, love one another earnestly from the heart. You have been born anew\, not of perishable seed but of imperishable\, through the living and abiding word of God; for \"All flesh is like grass and all its glory like the flower of grass. The grass withers\, and the flower falls\, but the word of the Lord abides for ever.\" That word is the good news which was preached to you.\n\nSo put away all malice and all guile and insincerity and envy and all slander. Like newborn babes\, long for the pure spiritual milk\, that by it you may grow up to salvation; for you have tasted the kindness of the Lord.\n\nCome to him\, to that living stone\, rejected by men but in God's sight chosen and precious; and like living stones be yourselves built into a spiritual house\, to be a holy priesthood\, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For it stands in scripture: “Behold\, I am laying in Zion a stone\, a cornerstone chosen and precious\, and he who believes in him will not be put to shame.” To you therefore who believe\, he is precious\, but for those who do not believe\, “The very stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner\,” and “A stone that will make men stumble\, a rock that will make them fall”; for they stumble because they disobey the word\, as they were destined to do. But you are a chosen race\, a royal priesthood\, a holy nation\, God’s own people\, that you may declare the wonderful deeds of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. Once you were no people but now you are God’s people; once you had not received mercy but now you have received mercy.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 18:18-22;19:1-2; 13-15\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"Truly\, I say to you\, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven\, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Again I say to you\, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask\, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. For where two or three are gathered in my name\, there am I in the midst of them.\"\n\nThen Peter came up and said to him\, \"Lord\, how often shall my brother sin against me\, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?\" Jesus said to him\, \"I do not say to you seven times\, but seventy times seven.\"\n\nNow when Jesus had finished these sayings\, he went away from Galilee and entered the region of Judea beyond the Jordan; and large crowds followed him\, and he healed them there.\n\nThen children were brought to him that he might lay his hands on them and pray. The disciples rebuked the people; but Jesus said\, \"Let the children come to me\, and do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.\" And he laid his hands on them and went away.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 08/06/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Transfiguration of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ\n\nFast Day (Fish Allowed)\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Luke 9:28-36\nAt that time\, Jesus took with him Peter and John and James\, and went up on the mountain to pray. And as he was praying\, the appearance of his countenance was altered\, and his raiment became dazzling white. And behold\, two men talked with him\, Moses and Elijah\, who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure\, which he was to accomplish at Jerusalem. Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep\, and when they wakened they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him. And as the men were parting from him\, Peter said to Jesus\, \"Master\, it is well that we are here; let us make three booths\, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah\" - not knowing what he said. As he said this\, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. And a voice came out of the cloud\, saying\, \"This is my Son\, my Beloved; listen to him!\" And when the voice had spoken\, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silence and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen.\n\nEpistle Reading: II Peter 1:10-19\nBRETHREN\, be more zealous to confirm your call and election\, for if you do this you will never fall; so there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\n\nTherefore I intend always to remind you of these things\, though you know them and are established in the truth that you have. I think it right\, as long as I am in this body\, to arouse you by way of reminder\, since I know that the putting off of my body will be soon\, as our Lord Jesus Christ showed me. And I will see to it that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall these things.\n\nFor we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ\, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. For when he received honor and glory from God the Father and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory\, \"This is my beloved Son\, with whom I am well pleased\,\" we heard this voice borne from heaven\, for we were with him on the holy mountain. And we have the prophetic word made more sure. You will do well to pay attention to this as to a lamp shining in a dark place\, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 17:1-9\nAt that time\, Jesus took with him Peter and James and John his brother\, and led them up a high mountain apart. And he was transfigured before them\, and his face shone like the sun\, and his garments became white as light. And behold\, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah\, talking with him. And Peter said to Jesus\, \"Lord\, it is well that we are here; if you wish\, I will make three booths here\, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.\" He was still speaking\, when lo\, a bright cloud overshadowed them\, and a voice from the cloud said\, \"This is my beloved Son\, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.\" When the disciples heard this\, they fell on their faces\, and were filled with awe. But Jesus came and touched them\, saying\, \"Rise\, and have no fear.\" And when they lifted up their eyes\, they saw no one but Jesus only. And as they were coming down the mountain\, Jesus commanded them\, \"Tell no one the vision\, until the Son of man is raised from the dead.\"\n\n

If even lifeless instruments\, such as the flute or the harp\, do not give distinct notes\, how will any one know what is played? And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound\, who will get ready for battle? So with yourselves; if you in a tongue utter speech that is not intelligible\, how will any one know what is said? For you will be speaking into the air. There are doubtless many different languages in the world\, and none is without meaning; but if I do not know the meaning of the language\, I shall be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me. So with yourselves; since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit\, strive to excell in building up the church. Therefore\, he who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret. For if I pray in a tongue\, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful. What am I to do? I will pray with spirit and I will sing with the mind also. Otherwise\, if you bless with the spirit\, how can any one in the position of an outsider say the \"Amen\" to your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying? For you may give thanks well enough\, but the other man is not edified. I thank God that I speak in tongues more than you all; nevertheless\, in church I would rather speak five words with my mind\, in order to instruct others\, than ten thousand words in a tongue.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 9:2-9\nAt that time\, Jesus took with him Peter and James and John\, and led them up a high mountain apart by themselves; and he was transfigured before them\, and his garments became glistening\, intensely white\, as no fuller on earth could bleach them. And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses; and they were talking to Jesus. And Peter said to Jesus\, \"Master\, it is well that we are here; let us make three booths\, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.\" For he did not know what to say\, for they were exceedingly afraid. And a cloud overshadowed them\, and a voice came out of the cloud\, \"This is my beloved son; listen to him.\" And suddenly\, looking around they no longer saw any one with them but Jesus only. And as they were coming down the mountain he charged them to tell no one what they had seen\, until the Son of man should have risen from the dead.\n\n

Let all things be done for edification. If any speak in a tongue\, let there be only two or at most three\, and each in turn; and let one interpret. But if there is no one to interpret\, let each one of them keep silence in church and speak to himself and to God. Let two or three prophets speak\, and let the others weigh what is said. If a revelation is made to another by sitting by\, let the first be silent. For you can all prophesy one by one\, so that all may learn and all be encouraged; and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets. But God is not a God of confusion but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints\, the women should keep silence in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak\, but should be subordinate\, as even the law says. If there is anything they desire to know\, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church. What! Did the word of God originate with you\, or are you the only one it has reached? If any one thinks that he is a prophet\, or spiritual\, he should acknowledge that what I am writing to you is a command of the Lord. If any one does not recognize this\, he is not recognized. So\, my brethren\, earnestly desire to prophesy\, and do not forbid speaking in tongues; but all things should be done decently and in order. \n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 21:12-14; 17-20\nAt that time\, Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple\, and he overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. He said to them\, \"It is written\, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer'; but you make it a den of robbers.\" And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple\, and he healed them. And leaving them\, he went out of the city to Bethany and lodged there.\n\nIn the morning\, as he was returning to the city\, he was hungry. And seeing a fig tree by the wayside he went to it\, and found nothing on it but leaves only. And he said to it\, \"May no fruit ever come from you again!\" And the fig tree withered at once. When the disciples saw it they marveled\, saying\, \"How did the fig tree wither at once?\"\n\n

All these with one accord devoted themselves to prayer\, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus\, and with his brothers.\n\nIn those days Peter stood up among the brethren (the company of persons was in all about a hundred and twenty)\, and said\, \"Brethren\, the scripture had to be fulfilled\, which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David\, concerning Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus. For he was numbered among us\, and was allotted his share in this ministry. \"So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us\, beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us -- one of these men must become with us a witness to his resurrection.\"\n\nAnd they put forward two\, Joseph called Barsabbas\, who was surnamed Justos\, and Matthias. And they prayed and said\, \"Lord\, who knowest the hearts of all men\, show which one of these two thou hast chosen to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside\, to go to his own place.\" And they cast lots for them\, and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was enrolled with the eleven apostles.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 15:32-39\nAt that time\, Jesus called his disciples to him and said\, \"I have compassion on the crowd\, because they have been with me now three days\, and have nothing to eat; and I am unwilling to send them away hungry\, lest they faint on the way.\" And the disciples said to him\, \"Where are we to get bread enough in the desert to feed so great a crowd?\" And Jesus said to them\, \"How many loaves have you?\" They said\, \"Seven\, and a few small fish.\" And commanding the crowd to sit down on the ground\, he took the seven loaves and the fish\, and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples\, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. And they all ate and were satisfied; and they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left over. Those who ate were four thousand men\, besides women and children. And sending away the crowds\, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.\n\n

SUMMARY:9th Sunday of Matthew
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 08/10/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: 9th Sunday of Matthew; Laurence the Holy Martyr & Archdeacon of Rome; Chitus of Athens\, Bishop of Rome; Hippolytus the Martyr of Rome; Afterfeast of the Transfiguration of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ\n\nFast Day (Wine and Oil Allowed)\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: John 20:19-31\nOn the evening of that day\, the first day of the week\, the doors being shut where the disciples were for fear of the Jews\, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them\, \"Peace be with you.\" When He had said this\, He showed them His hands and His side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again\, \"Peace be with you. As the Father has sent Me\, even so I send you.\" And when He had said this\, He breathed on them and said to them\, \"Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any\, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any\, they are retained.\" Now Thomas\, one of the twelve\, called the Twin\, was not with them when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him\, \"We have seen the Lord.\" But he said to them\, \"Unless I see in His hands the print of the nails\, and place my finger in the mark of the nails\, and place my hand in His side\, I will not believe.\" Eight days later\, His disciples were again in the house\, and Thomas was with them. The doors were shut\, but Jesus came and stood among them and said\, \"Peace be with you.\" Then He said to Thomas\, \"Put your finger here\, and see My hands; and put out your hand\, and place it in My side; do not be faithless\, but believing.\" Thomas answered Him\, \"My Lord and My God!\" Jesus said to him\, \"Have you believed because you have seen Me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe.\" Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples\, which are not written in this book; but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ\, the Son of God\, and that believing\, you may have life in His name.\n\nEpistle Reading: I Corinthians 3:9-17\nBrethren\, we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field\, God's building. According to the grace of God given to me\, like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation\, and another man is building upon it. Let each man take care how he builds upon it. For no other foundation can any one lay than that which is laid\, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any one builds on the foundation with gold\, silver\, precious stones\, wood\, hay\, straw - each man's work will become manifest; for the Day will disclose it\, because it will be revealed with fire\, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done. If the work which any man has built on the foundation survives\, he will receive a reward. If any man's work is burned up\, he will suffer loss\, though he himself will be saved\, but only as through fire. Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you? If any one destroys God's temple\, God will destroy him. For God's temple is holy\, and that temple you are.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 14:22-34\nAt that time\, Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side\, while he dismissed the crowds. And after he had dismissed the crowds\, he went up into the hills by himself to pray. When evening came\, he was there alone\, but the boat by this time was many furlongs distant from the land\, beaten by the waves; for the wind was against them. And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them\, walking on the sea. But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea\, they were terrified\, saying\, \"It is a ghost!\" And they cried out for fear. But immediately he spoke to them\, saying \"Take heart\, it is I; have no fear.\" \n\n And Peter answered him\, \"Lord\, if it is you\, bid me come to you on the water.\" He said\, \"Come.\" So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus; but when he saw the wind\, he was afraid\, and beginning to sink he cried out\, \"Lord\, save me.\" Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him\, saying to him\, \"O man of little faith\, why did you doubt?\" And when they entered the boat\, the wind ceased. And those in the boat worshiped him\, saying\, \"Truly you are the Son of God.\" And when they had crossed over\, they came to land at Gennesaret.\n\n

But if there is no resurrection of the dead\, then Christ has not been raised; if Christ has not been raised\, then our preaching is in vain. We are even found to be misrepresenting God\, because we testified of God that he raised Christ\, whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised. For if the dead are not raised\, then Christ has not been raised. If Christ has not been raised\, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If for this life only we have hoped in Christ\, we are of all men most to be pitied.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 21:18-22\nAt that time\, as Jesus was returning to the city\, he was hungry. And seeing a fig tree by the wayside he went to it\, and found nothing on it but leaves only. And he said to it\, \"May no fruit ever come from you again!\" And the fig tree withered at once. When the disciples saw it they marveled\, saying\, \"How did the fig tree wither at once?\" And Jesus answered them\, \"Truly\, I say to you\, if you have faith and never doubt\, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree\, but even if you say to this mountain\, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea\,' it will be done. And whatever you ask in prayer\, you will receive\, if you have faith.\"\n\n

If the dead are not raised at all\, why are people baptized on their behalf? Why am I in peril every hour? I protest\, brethren\, by my pride in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord\, I die every day! What do I gain if\, humanly speaking\, I fought with beasts at Ephesos? If the dead are not raised\, \"Let us eat and drink\, for tomorrow we die.\" Do not be deceived: \"Bad company ruins good morals.\" Come to your right mind\, and sin no more. For some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame. But some one will ask\, \"How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?\" You foolish man! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. And what you sow is not the body which is to be\, but a bare kernel\, perhaps of wheat or some other grain. But God gives it a body as he has chosen\, and to each kind of seed its own body.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 21:23-27\nAt that time\, when Jesus entered the temple\, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching\, and said\, \"By what authority are you doing these things\, and who gave you this authority?\" Jesus answered them\, \"I also will ask you a question; and if you tell me the answer\, then I also will tell you by what authority I do these things. The baptism of John\, whence was it? From heaven or from men?\" And they argued with one another\, \"If we say\, 'From heaven\,' he will say to us\, 'Why then did you not believe him?' But if we say\, 'From men\,' we are afraid of the multitude; for all hold that John was a prophet.\" So they answered Jesus\, \"We do not know.\" And he said to them\, \"Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.\"\n\n

I will visit you after passing through Macedonia\, for I intend to pass through Macedonia\, and perhaps I will stay with you or even spend the winter\, so that you may speed me on my journey\, wherever I go. For I do not want to see you now just in passing; I hope to spend some time with you\, if the Lord permits. But I will stay in Ephesos until Pentecost\, for a wide door for effective work has opened to me\, and there are many adversaries. When Timothy comes\, see that you put him at ease among you\, for he is doing the work of the Lord\, as I am. So let no one despise him. Speed him on his way in peace\, that he may return to me; for I am expecting him with the brethren. As for our brother Apollos\, I strongly urge him to visit you with the other brethren\, but it was not at all his will to come now. He will come when he has the opportunity.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 21:28-32\nThe Lord said this parable\, \"A man had two sons; and he went to the first and said\, 'Son\, go and work in the vineyard today.' And he answered\, 'I will not'; but afterward he repented and went. And he went to the second and said the same; and he answered\, 'I go\, sir\,' but did not go. Which of the two did the will of his father?\" They said\, \"The first.\" Jesus said to them\, \"Truly\, I say to you\, the tax collectors and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. For John came to you in the way of righteousness\, and you did not believe him\, but the tax collectors and the harlots believed him and even when you saw it\, you did not afterward repent and believe him.\"\n\n

For as the sufferings of Christ abound for us\, so also our comfort abounds through Christ. If we are afflicted\, it is for your comfort and salvation; and if we are comforted\, it is for your comfort\, which you experience when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we suffer. Our hope for you is unshaken; for we know that as you share in our sufferings\, you all also share in our comfort.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 21:43-46\nThe Lord said to the Jews who had come to him: \"I tell you\, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation producing the fruits of it. And he who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; but when it falls on any one\, it will crush him.\"\n\nWhen the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables\, they perceived that he was speaking about them.

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 08/15/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: The Dormition of our Most Holy Lady the Theotokos and Ever Virgin Mary\n\nFast Day (Fish Allowed)\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Luke 1:39-49\, 56\nIn those days\, Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country\, to a city of Judah\, and she entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth. And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary\, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and she exclaimed with a loud cry\, \"Blessed are you among women\, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why is this granted me\, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold\, when the voice of your greeting came to my ears\, the babe in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.\"\n\n  And Mary said\, \"My soul magnifies the Lord\, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior\, for he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden. For behold\, henceforth all generations will call me blessed; for he who is mighty has done great things for me\, and holy is his name.\" And Mary remained with her about three months\, and returned to her home.\n\nEpistle Reading: Philippians 2:5-11\nBrethren\, have this mind among yourselves\, which is yours in Christ Jesus\, who\, though he was in the form of God\, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped\, but emptied himself\, taking the form of a servant\, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form he humbled himself and became obedient unto death\, even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above every name\, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow\, in heaven and on earth and under the earth\, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord\, to the glory of God the Father.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 10:38-42\, 11:27-28\nAt that time\, Jesus entered a village; and a woman called Martha received him into her house. And she had a sister called Mary\, who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his teaching. But Martha was distracted with much serving; and she went to him and said\, \"Lord\, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve you alone? Tell her then to help me.\" But the Lord answered her\, \"Martha\, Martha\, you are anxious and troubled about many things; one thing is needful. Mary has chosen the good portion\, which shall not be taken away from her.\" As he said this\, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him\, \"Blessed is the womb that bore you\, and the breasts that you sucked!\" But he said\, \"Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it!\"\n\n

I hope to come to you soon\, but I am writing these instructions to you so that\, if I am delayed\, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God\, which is the church of the living God\, the pillar and bulwark of the truth. Great indeed\, we confess\, is the mystery of our religion:\n\nGod was manifested in the flesh\, \njustified in the Spirit\, \nseen by angels\, \npreached among the nations\, \nbelieved on in the world\, \ntaken up in glory.\n\nNow the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by giving heed to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons\, through the pretensions of liars whose consciences are seared\, who forbid marriage and enjoin abstinence from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth. For everything created by God is good\, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving; for then it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 9:51-57\, 10:22-24\, 13:22\nAt that time\, when the days drew near for him to be received up\, he set his face to go to Jerusalem. And he sent messengers ahead of him\, who went and entered a village of the Samaritans\, to make ready for him; but the people would not receive him\, because his face was set toward Jerusalem. And when his disciples James and John saw it\, they said\, \"Lord\, do you want us to bid fire come down from heaven and consume them as Elijah did?\" But he turned and rebuked them\, and he said\, \"You do not know what manner of spirit you are of; for the Son of man came not to destroy men's lives but to save them.\" And they went on to another village.\n\nAs they were going along the road\, he said to those who followed him\, \"All things have been delivered to me by my Father; and no one knows who the Son is except the Father\, or who the Father is except the Son and any one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.\" Then turning to the disciples he said privately\, \"Blessed are the eyes which see what you see! For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see\, and did not see it\, and to hear what you hear\, and did not hear it.\"\n\nAnd he went on his way through towns and villages\, teaching\, and journeying towards Jerusalem.\n\n

Simon Peter\, Thomas\, called the Twin\, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee\, the sons of Zebedee\, and two others of His disciples were together. Simon Peter said to them\, \"I am going fishing.\" They said to him\, \"We will go with you.\" They went out and got into the boat\, but that night they caught nothing. Just as day was breaking\, Jesus stood on the beach\, yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to them\, \"Children\, have you any fish?\" They answered him\, \"No.\" He said to them\, \"Cast the net on the right side of the boat\, and you will find some.\" So they cast it\, and now they were not able to haul it in\, for the quantity of fish. That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter\, \"It is the Lord!\" When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord\, he put on his clothes\, for he was stripped for work\, and sprang into the sea. But the other disciples came in the boat\, dragging the net full of fish\, for they were not far from the land\, but about a hundred yards off. When they got out on land\, they saw a charcoal fire there with fish lying on it\, and bread. Jesus said to them\, \"Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.\" So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore\, full of large fish\, a hundred and fifty-three of them; and although there were so many\, the net was not torn. Jesus said to them\, \"Come and have breakfast.\" Now none of the disciples dared ask Him\, \"Who are you?\" They knew it was the Lord. Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them\, and so with the fish. This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after He was raised from the dead..\n\nEpistle Reading: I Corinthians 4:9-16\nBrethren\, God has exhibited us apostles as last of all\, like men sentenced to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world\, to angels and to men. We are fools for Christ's sake\, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak\, but you are strong. You are held in honor\, but we in disrepute. To the present hour we hunger and thirst\, we are ill-clad and buffeted and homeless\, and we labor\, working with our own hands. When reviled\, we bless; when persecuted\, we endure; when slandered\, we try to conciliate; we have become\, and are now\, as the refuse of the world\, the off-scouring of all things. I do not write this to make you ashamed\, but to admonish you as my beloved children. For though you have countless guides in Christ\, you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel. I urge you\, then\, be imitators of me.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 17:14-23\nAt that time\, a man came up to Jesus and kneeling before him said\, \"Lord\, have mercy on my son\, for he is an epileptic and he suffers terribly; for often he falls into the fire\, and often into the water.  And I brought him to your disciples\, and they could not heal him.\"  And Jesus answered\, \"O faithless and perverse generation\, how long am I to be with you?  How long am I to bear with you?  Bring him here to me.\"  And Jesus rebuked him\, and the demon came out of him\, and the boy was cured instantly.  Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said\, \"Why could we not cast it out?\"  He said to them\, \"Because of your little faith.  For truly I say to you\, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed\, you will say to this mountain\, 'Move hence to yonder place\,' and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you.  But this kind never comes out except by prayer and fasting.\"  As they were gathering in Galilee\, Jesus said to them\,  \"The Son of man is to be delivered into the hands of men\, and they will kill him\, and he will be raised on the third day.\"\n\n

For I wrote you out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears\, not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you.\n\nBut if any one has caused pain\, he has caused it not to me\, but in some measure - not to put it too severely - to you all. For such a one this punishment by the majority is enough; so you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him\, for he may be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. So I beg you to reaffirm your love for him. For this is why I wrote\, that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything. Any one whom you forgive\, I also forgive. What I have forgiven\, if I have forgiven anything\, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ\, to keep Satan from gaining the advantage over us; for we are not ignorant of his designs.\n\nWhen I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ\, a door was opened for me in the Lord; but my mind could not rest because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I took leave of them and went on to Macedonia.\n\nBut thanks be to God\, who in Christ always leads us in triumph\, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere. For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 23:13-22\nThe Lord said to the Jews who had come to him\, \"Woe to you\, scribes and Pharisees\, hypocrites! for you devour widows' houses and for a pretense you make long prayers; therefore you will receive the greater condemnation. But woe to you\, scribes and Pharisees\, hypocrites! because you shut the kingdom of heaven against men; for you neither enter yourselves\, nor allow those who would enter to go in. Woe to you\, scribes and Pharisees\, hypocrites! for you traverse sea and land to make a single proselyte\, and when he becomes a proselyte\, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves. Woe to you\, blind guides\, who say\, 'If any one swears by the temple\, it is nothing; but if any one swears by the gold of the temple\, he is bound by his oath.' You blind fools! For which is greater\, the gold or the temple that has made the gold sacred? And you say\, 'If any one swears by the altar\, it is nothing; but if any one swears by the gift that is on the altar\, he is bound by his oath.' You blind men! For which is greater\, the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred? So he who swears by the altar\, swears by it and by everything on it; and he who swears by the temple\, swears by it and by him who dwells in it; and he who swears by heaven\, swears by the throne of God and by him who sits upon it.\"\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 08/19/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Andrew the General & Martyr & his 2\,593 soldiers; Holy Martyrs Timothy\, Agapius and Thecla; Theophanes the New Wonderworker of Macedonia; Afterfeast of the Dormition of our Most Holy Lady the Theotokos and Ever Virgin Mary; Eutychianos and Strategios the Martyrs\n\nEpistle Reading: II Corinthians 2:14-17;3:1-3\nBrethren\, thanks be to God\, who in Christ always leads us in triumph\, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere. For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing\, to one a fragrance from death to death\, to the other a fragrance from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things? For we are not\, like so many\, peddlers of God's word; but as men of sincerity\, as commissioned by God\, in the sight of God we speak in Christ.\n\nAre we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need\, as some do\, letters of recommendation\, to you\, or from you? You yourselves are our letter of recommendation\, written on our hearts\, to be known and read by all men; and you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us\, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God\, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 23:23-28\nThe Lord said to the Jews who had come to him\, \"Woe to you\, scribes and Pharisees\, hypocrites! for you tithe mint and dill and cumin\, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law\, justice and mercy and faith; these you ought to have done\, without neglecting the others. You blind guides\, straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel!\n\n\"Woe to you\, scribes and Pharisees\, hypocrites! for you cleanse the outside of the cup and of the plate\, but inside they are full of extortion and rapacity. You blind Pharisee! first cleanse the inside of the cup and of the plate\, that the outside also may be clean.\n\n\"Woe to you\, scribes and Pharisees\, hypocrites! for you are like whitewashed tombs\, which outwardly appear beautiful\, but within they are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. So you also outwardly appear righteous to men\, but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.\"\n\n

SUMMARY:Samuel the Prophet
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 08/20/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Samuel the Prophet; Holy Martyr Luke of Bouleutos; Stephen\, First King of Hungary; Hierotheos\, Bishop of Hungary; Oswin the Martyr\, King of Deira; Afterfeast of the Dormition of our Most Holy Lady the Theotokos and Ever Virgin Mary\n\nStrict Fast\n\nEpistle Reading: II Corinthians 3:4-11\nBrethren\, such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God. Not that we are competent of ourselves to claim anything as coming from us; our competence is from God\, who has made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant\, not in a written code but in the Spirit; for the written code kills\, but the Spirit gives life.\n\nNow if the dispensation of death\, carved in letters on stone\, came with such splendor that the Israelites could not look at Moses' face because of its brightness\, fading as this was\, will not the dispensation of the Spirit be attended with greater splendor? For if there was splendor in the dispensation of condemnation\, the dispensation of righteousness must far exceed it in splendor. Indeed\, in this case\, what once had splendor has come to have no splendor at all\, because of the splendor that surpasses it. For if what faded away came with splendor\, what is permanent must have much more splendor.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 23:29-39\nThe Lord said to the Jews who had come to him\, \"Woe to you\, scribes and Pharisees\, hypocrites! for you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous\, saying\, 'If we had lived in the days of our fathers\, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.' Thus you witness against yourselves\, that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets. Fill up\, then\, the measure of your fathers. You serpents\, you brood of vipers\, how are you to escape being sentenced to hell? Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and scribes\, some of whom you will kill and crucify\, and some you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from town to town\, that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth\, from the blood of innocent Abel to the blood of Zacharias the son of Barachiah\, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar. Truly\, I say to you\, all this will come upon this generation.\n\nO Jerusalem\, Jerusalem\, killing the prophets and stoning those who are sent to you! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings\, and you would not! Behold\, your house is forsaken and desolate. For I tell you\, you will not see me again\, until you say\, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'\"\n\n

SUMMARY:The Holy Apostle Thaddaeus
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 08/21/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: The Holy Apostle Thaddaeus; The Holy Martyr Bassa and Her Sons: Theognis\, Agapius\, and Pistus; Athanasios Patelaros\, Patriarch of Constantinople; Afterfeast of the Dormition of our Most Holy Lady the Theotokos and Ever Virgin Mary\n\nEpistle Reading: II Corinthians 4:1-12\nBrethren\, having this ministry as we have received mercy\, we do not lose heart. We have renounced disgraceful\, underhanded ways; we refuse to practice cunning or to tamper with God's word\, but by the open statement of truth we would commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. And even if our gospel is veiled\, it is veiled only to those who are perishing. In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers\, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ\, who is the likeness of God. For what we preach is not ourselves\, but Jesus Christ as Lord\, with ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake. For it is the God who said\, \"Let light shine out of darkness\,\" who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.\n\nBut we have this treasure in earthen vessels\, to show that the transcendent power belongs to God and not to us. We are afflicted in every way\, but not crushed; perplexed\, but not driven to despair; persecuted\, but not forsaken; struck down\, but not destroyed; always carrying in the body the death of Jesus\, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies. For while we live we are always being given up to death for Jesus' sake\, so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh. So death is at work in us\, but life in you.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 3:13-21\nAt that time\, Jesus went up on the mountain\, and called to him those whom he desired; and they came to him. And he appointed twelve\, to be with him\, and to be sent out to preach and have authority to cast out demons: Simon whom he surnamed Peter; James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James\, whom he surnamed Boanerges\, that is\, sons of thunder; Andrew and Philip and Bartholomew\, and Matthew\, and Thomas\, and James the son of Alphaios\, and Thaddaios\, and Simon the Cananaean\, and Judas Iscariot\, who betrayed him. Then he went home; and the crowd came together again\, so that they could not even eat. And when his family heard it\, they went out to seize him\, for people were saying\, \"He is beside himself.\"\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 08/22/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: The Holy Martyr Agathonicus; Holy Martyr Anthuse; Athanasios the Hieromartyr & Bishop of Tarsus; New Martyrs Manuel and John; The Synaxis of the Icon of the Mother of God of Prusa; Afterfeast of the Dormition of our Most Holy Lady the Theotokos and Ever Virgin Mary\n\nStrict Fast\n\nEpistle Reading: II Corinthians 4:13-18\nBrethren\, since we have the same spirit of faith as he had who wrote\, \"I believed\, and so I spoke\,\" we too believe\, and so we speak\, knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence. For it is all for your sake\, so that as grace extends to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving\, to the glory of God.\n\nSo we do not lose heart. Though our outer nature is wasting away\, our inner nature is being renewed every day. For this slight momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison\, because we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen; for the things that are seen are transient\, but the things that are unseen are eternal.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 24:27-33\, 42-51\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"As the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west\, so will be the coming of the Son of man. Wherever the body is\, there the eagles will be gathered together.\n\n\"Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened\, and the moon will not give its light\, and the stars will fall from heaven\, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken; then will appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven\, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn\, and they will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory; and he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call\, and they will gather his elect from the four winds\, from one end of heaven to the other.\n\n\"From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves\, you know that summer is near. So also\, when you see all these things\, you know that he is near\, at the very gates.\n\n\"Watch therefore\, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. But know this\, that if the householder had known in what part of the night the thief was coming\, he would have watched and would not have let his house be broken into. Therefore you also must be ready; for the Son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect.\n\n\"Who then is the faithful and wise servant\, whom his master has set over his household\, to give them their food at the proper time? Blessed is that servant whom his master when he comes will find so doing. Truly\, I say to you\, he will set him over all his possessions. But if that wicked servant says to himself\, 'My master is delayed\,' and begins to beat his fellow servants\, and eats and drinks with the drunken\, the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know\, and will punish him\, and put him with the hypocrites; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.\"\n\n

And being found in human form he humbled himself and became obedient unto death\, even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above every name\, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow\, in heaven and on earth and under the earth\, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord\, to the glory of God the Father.\n\nGospel Reading: Luke 10:38-42\, 11:27-28\nAt that time\, Jesus entered a village; and a woman called Martha received him into her house. And she had a sister called Mary\, who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his teaching. But Martha was distracted with much serving; and she went to him and said\, \"Lord\, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve you alone? Tell her then to help me.\" But the Lord answered her\, \"Martha\, Martha\, you are anxious and troubled about many things; one thing is needful. Mary has chosen the good portion\, which shall not be taken away from her.\" As he said this\, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him\, \"Blessed is the womb that bore you\, and the breasts that you sucked!\" But he said\, \"Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it!\"\n\n

SUMMARY:11th Sunday of Matthew
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 08/24/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: 11th Sunday of Matthew; Eutyches the Hieromartyr & Disciple of St. John the Theologian; Cosmas of Aetolia\, Equal to the Apostles; The Translation of the Relics of Dionysios of Zakynthos\, Bishop of Aegina; The Translation of the Holy Relics of Saint Peter\, Metropolitan of Moscow\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: John 21:14-25\nAt that time\, Jesus revealed himself to the disciples after he was raised from the dead. And he said to Simon Peter\, \"Simon\, son of John\, do you love me more than these?\" He said to him\, \"Yes\, Lord; you know that I love you.\" He said to him\, \"Feed my lambs.\" A second time he said to him\, \"Simon\, son of John\, do you love me?\" He said to him\, \"Yes\, Lord; you know that I love you.\" He said to him\, \"Tend my sheep.\" He said to him the third time\, \"Simon\, son of John\, do you love me?\" Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time\, \"Do you love me?\" And he said to him\, \"Lord\, you know everything; you know that I love you.\" Jesus said to him\, \"Feed my sheep. Truly\, truly\, I say to you\, when you were young\, you girded yourself and walked where you would; but when you are old\, you will stretch out your hands\, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go.\" (This he said to show by what death he was to glorify God.) And after this he said to him\, \"Follow me.\" Peter turned and saw following them the disciple whom Jesus loved\, who had lain close to his breast at the supper and had said\, \"Lord\, who is it that is going to betray you?\" When Peter saw him\, he said to Jesus\, \"Lord\, what about this man?\" Jesus said to him\, \"If it is my will that he remain until I come\, what is that to you? Follow me!\" The saying spread abroad among the brethren that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die\, but\, \"If it is my will that he remain until I come\, what is that to you?\" This is the disciple who is bearing witness to these things\, and who has written these things; and we know that his testimony is true. But there are also many other things which Jesus did; were every one of them to be written\, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen.\n\nEpistle Reading: I Corinthians 9:2-12\nBrethren\, you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord. This is my defense to those who would examine me. Do we not have the right to our food and drink? Do we not have the right to be accompanied by a wife\, as the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas? Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working for a living? Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard without eating any of its fruit? Who tends a flock without getting some of the milk? Do I say this on human authority? Does not the law say the same? For it is written in the law of Moses\, \"You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the grain.\" Is it for oxen that God is concerned? Does he not speak entirely for our sake? It was written for our sake\, because the plowman should plow in hope and the thresher thresh in hope of a share in the crop. If we have sown spiritual good among you\, is it too much if we reap your material benefits? If others share this rightful claim upon you\, do not we still more? Nevertheless\, we have not made use of this right\, but we endure anything rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 18:23-35\nThe Lord said this parable:  \"The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants.  When he began the reckoning\, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents; and as he could not pay\, his lord ordered him to be sold\, with his wife and children and all that he had\, and payment to be made.  So the servant fell on his knees\, imploring him\, 'Lord\, have patience with me\, and I will pay you everything.'  And out of pity for him the lord of that servant released him and forgave him the debt.  But that same servant\, as he went out\, came upon one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii; and seizing him by the throat he said\, 'Pay what you owe.' So his fellow servant fell down and besought him\, 'Have patience with me\, and I will pay you.'  He refused and went and put him in prison till he should pay the debt.  When his fellow servants saw what had taken place\, they were greatly distressed\, and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place.  Then his lord summoned him and said to him\, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you besought me; and should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant\, as I had mercy on you?'  And in anger his lord delivered him to the torturers\, till he should pay all his debt.  So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you\, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.\"\n\n

Let no one disregard you.\n\nRemind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities\, to be obedient\, to be ready for any honest work\, to speak evil of no one\, to avoid quarreling\, to be gentle\, and to show perfect courtesy toward all men.\n\nWhen I send Artemas or Tychicos to you\, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis\, for I have decided to spend the winter there. Do your best to speed Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way; see that they lack nothing. And let our people learn to apply themselves to good deeds\, so as to help cases of urgent need\, and not to be unfruitful.\n\nAll who are with me send greetings to you. Greet those who love us in the faith.\n\nGrace be with you all. Amen.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 5:14-19\nThe Lord said to his disciples\, \"You are the light of the world.  A city set on a hill cannot be hid.  Nor do men light a lamp and put it under a bushel\, but on a stand\, and it gives light to all in the house.  Let your light so shine before men\, that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.  Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfill them.  For truly\, I say to you\, till heaven and earth pass away\, not an iota\, not a dot\, will pass from the law until all is accomplished.  Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so\, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\"\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 08/26/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: The Holy Martyrs Adrian and Natalie; Our Righteous Father Joseph; Icon of the Mother of God of Vladimir\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 10:32-38\nBrethren\, recall the former days when\, after you were enlightened\, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings\, sometimes being publicly exposed to abuse and affliction\, and sometimes being partners with those so treated.  For you had compassion on the prisoners\, and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property\, since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one.  Therefore do not throw away your confidence\, which has a great reward.  For you have need of endurance\, so that you may do the will of God and receive what is promised.  \"For yet a little while\, and the coming one shall come and shall not tarry; but my righteous one shall live by faith.\"\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 1:16-22\nAt that time\, Jesus\, passing along by the Sea of Galilee\, saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea; for they were fishermen. And Jesus said to them\, \"Follow me and I will make you become fishers of men.\" And immediately they left their nets and followed him. And going on a little farther\, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother\, who were in their boats mending the nets. And immediately he called them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants\, and followed him. And they went into Capernaum; and immediately on the sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught. And they were astonished at his teaching\, for he taught them as one who had authority\, and not as the scribes.\n\n

You are not restricted by us\, but you are restricted in your own affections. In return -- I speak as to children -- widen your hearts also.\n\nDo not be mismated with unbelievers. For what partnership have righteousness and iniquity? Or what fellowship has light with darkness? What accord has Christ with Belial? Or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever?

Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are\, the Holy One of God.\" But Jesus rebuked him\, saying\, \"Be silent\, and come out of him!\" And the unclean spirit\, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice\, came out of him.

I do not say this to condemn you\, for I said before that you are in our hearts\, to die together and to live together. I have great confidence in you; I have great pride in you; I am filled with comfort. With all our affliction\, I am overjoyed.\n\nFor even when we came into Macedonia\, our bodies had no rest but we were afflicted at every turn --fighting without and fear within. But God\, who comforts the downcast\, comforted us by the coming of Titus\, and not only by his coming but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you\, as he told us of your longing\, your mourning\, your zeal for me\, so that I rejoiced still more. For even if I made you sorry with my letter\, I do not regret it (though I did regret it)\, for I see that that letter grieved you\, though only for a while. As it is\, I rejoice\, not because you were grieved\, but because you were grieved into repenting; for you felt a godly grief\, so that you suffered no loss through us. For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation and brings no regret\, but worldly grief produces death.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 1:29-35\nAt that time\, Jesus entered the house of Simon and Andrew\, with James and John. Now Simon's mother-in-law lay sick with a fever\, and immediately they told him of her. And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up\, and the fever left her; and she served them. That evening\, at sundown\, they brought to him all who were sick or possessed with demons. And the whole city was gathered together about the door. And he healed many who were sick with various diseases\, and cast out many demons; and he would not permit the demons to speak\, because they knew him. And in the morning\, a great while before day\, he rose and went out to a lonely place\, and there he prayed.\n\n

SUMMARY:Beheading of the Holy and Glorious Prophet\, Forerunner and Baptist John
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 08/29/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Beheading of the Holy and Glorious Prophet\, Forerunner and Baptist John; Theodora of Thessaloniki; Anastasios the New Martyr of Bulgaria\n\nStrict Fast\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Matthew 14:1-13\nAt that time\, Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus; and he said to his servants\, \"This is John the Baptist; he has been raised from the dead; that is why these powers are at work in him.\" For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison\, for the sake of Herodias\, his brother Philip's wife; because John said to him\, \"It is not lawful for you to have her.\" And though he wanted to put him to death\, he feared the people\, because they held him to be a prophet. But when Herod's birthday came\, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and pleased Herod\, so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask. Prompted by her mother\, she said\, \"Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.\" And the king was sorry; but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given; he sent and had John beheaded in the prison\, and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl\, and she brought it to her mother. And his disciples came and took the body and buried it; and they went and told Jesus. Now when Jesus heard this\, he withdrew from there in a boat to a lonely place apart. But when the crowds heard it\, they followed him on foot from the towns.\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 13:25-33\nIN THOSE DAYS\, as John was finishing his course\, he said\, \"What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No\, but after me one is coming\, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.\" Brethren\, sons of the family of Abraham\, and those among you that fear God\, to us has been sent the message of this salvation. For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers\, because they did not recognize him nor understand the utterances of the prophets which are read every sabbath\, fulfilled these by condemning him. Though they could charge him with nothing deserving death\, yet they asked Pilate to have him killed. And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him\, they took him down from the tree\, and laid him in a tomb. But God raised him from the dead; and for many days he appeared to those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem\, who are now his witnesses to the people. And we bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers\, this he has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 6:14-30\nAt that time\, Herod the King heard about the fame of Jesus\, for his name had become known. He said\, \"John the baptizer has been raised from the dead; that is why these powers are at work in him.\" But others said\, \"It is Elijah.\" And others said\, \"It is a prophet\, like one of the prophets of old.\" But when Herod heard of it he said\, \"John\, whom I beheaded\, has been raised.\" For Herod had sent and seized John\, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias\, his brother Philip's wife; because he had married her. For John said to Herod\, \"It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.\" And Herodias had a grudge against him\, and wanted to kill him. But she could not\, for Herod feared John\, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man\, and kept him safe. When he heard him\, he was much perplexed; and yet he heard him gladly. But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his courtiers and officers and the leading men of Galilee. For when Herodias' daughter came in and danced\, she pleased Herod and his guests; and the king said to the girl\, \"Ask me for whatever you wish\, and I will grant it.\" And he vowed to her\, \"Whatever you ask me\, I will give you\, even half of my kingdom.\" And she went out\, and said to her mother\, \"What shall I ask?\" And she said\, \"The head of John the baptizer.\" And she came in immediately with haste to the king\, and asked\, saying\, \"I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.\" And the king was exceedingly sorry; but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her. And immediately the king sent a soldier of the guard and gave orders to bring his head. He went and beheaded him in the prison\, and brought his head on a platter\, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother. When his disciples heard of it\, they came and took his body\, and laid it in a tomb. The apostles returned to Jesus\, and told him all that they had done and taught.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 08/30/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: Apodosis of the Feast of the Forerunner; Alexander\, John\, and Paul the New\, Patriarchs of Constantinople; Phantinos the Righteous of Calabria; 16 Monk-martyrs of Thebes; 6 Martyrs of Melitene; The Synaxis of the Holy Hierarchs of Serbia; The Holy New Martyrs of Serbia; Fiacre the Hermit of Meaux\n\nEpistle Reading: I Corinthians 1:26-31;2:1-5\nBrethren\, consider your call\, not many of you were wise according to worldly standards\, not many were powerful\, not many were of noble birth; but God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise\, God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong\, God chose what is low and despised in the world\, even things that are not\, to bring to nothing things that are\, so that no human being might boast in the presence of God. He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus\, whom God made our wisdom\, our righteousness and sanctification and redemption; therefore\, as it is written\, \"Let him who boasts\, boast of the Lord.\" When I came to you\, brethren\, I did not come proclaiming to you the testimony of God in lofty words or wisdom. For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified. And I was with you in weakness and in much fear and trembling; and my speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom\, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power\, that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 20:29-34\nAt that time\, as Jesus went out of Jericho\, a great crowd followed him. And behold\, two blind men sitting by the roadside\, when they heard that Jesus was passing by\, cried out\, \"Have mercy on us\, Son of David!\" The crowd rebuked them\, telling them to be silent; but they cried out the more\, \"Lord\, have mercy on us\, Son of David!\" And Jesus stopped and called them\, saying\, \"What do you want me to do for you?\" They said to him\, \"Lord\, let our eyes be opened.\" And Jesus in pity touched their eyes\, and immediately they received their sight and followed him.\n\n

SUMMARY:12th Sunday of Matthew
DESCRIPTION:Saints\, Feasts\, and Readings for 08/31/2025\n\nSaints and Feasts: 12th Sunday of Matthew; The Placing of the Honorable Sash of the Most Holy Theotokos; Cyprian the Hieromartyr & Bishop of Carthage; Gennadius Scholarus\, Patriarch of Constantinople; Aidan\, Bishop of Lindisfarne; Eanswythe\, Abbess of Folkestone; Cuthburga the Queen\, Abbess of Wimborne\n\nMatins Gospel Reading: Matthew 28:16-20\nAt that time\, the eleven disciples went to Galilee\, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them. And when they saw Him they worshiped Him; but some doubted. And Jesus came and said to them\, \"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations\, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit\, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo\, I am with you always\, to the close of the age. Amen.\"\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 9:1-7\nBRETHREN\, the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary. For a tent was prepared\, the outer one\, in which were the lampstand and the table and the bread of the Presence; it is called the Holy Place. Behind the second curtain stood a tent called the Holy of Holies\, having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold\, which contained a golden urn holding the manna\, and Aaron's rod that budded\, and the tables of the covenant; above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail. These preparations having thus been made\, the priests go continually into the outer tent\, performing their ritual duties; but into the second only the high priest goes\, and he but once a year\, and not without taking blood which he offers for himself and for the errors of the people.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 19:16-26\nAt that time\, a young man came up to Jesus\, kneeling and saying\, \"Good Teacher\, what good deed must I do\, to have eternal life?\" And he said to him\, \"Why do you call me good?  One there is who is good.  If you would enter life\, keep the commandments.\"  He said to him\, \"Which?\"  And Jesus said\, \"You shall not kill\, You shall not commit adultery\, You shall not steal\, You shall not bear false witness\, Honor your father and mother\, and You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\"  The young man said to him\, \"All these I have observed; what do I still lack?\"  Jesus said to him\, \"If you would be perfect\, go\, sell what you possess and give to the poor\, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come\, follow me.\"  When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions.\n\nAnd Jesus said to his disciples\, \"Truly\, I say to you\, it will be hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.  Again I tell you\, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\"  When the disciples heard this they were greatly astonished\, saying\, \"Who then can be saved?\"  But Jesus looked at them and said to them\, \"With men this is impossible\, but with God all things are possible.\"\n\n
